&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/09/19/deep-dive-spotify-part-two.html&quot;&gt;previous post on Spotify’s all-orchestra playlist&lt;/a&gt;, we’re now turning back to the calm and digression-worthy world of mood playlists with a look at Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;2 (2.8%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women of Colour&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Living&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;36 (50%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html#relaxing-classical&quot;&gt;Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;Relaxing Classical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this mood-themed playlist has representation of at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; composer of colour with the two pieces by Alexis Ffrench, and one more piece by a female composer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the two mood-themed playlists are wildly different when it comes to living composers, because they seem to have very different programming approaches. Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;Relaxing Classical&lt;/em&gt; takes the existing “canon” and selects mood-appropriate pieces from within it. Pieces by Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, Debussy, and Rachmaninoff make up nearly half of the playlist. As a result, only two of the tracks featured are by living composers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has 36 tracks by living composers, half of the overall total. This is because “Classical” in Spotify’s parlance means a mix of mood-appropriate pieces from the “canon” alongside modern artists who make mood music using classical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The living composers responsible for those 36 tracks range from often-anonymous artists, &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/streaming-service-demographic-analysis.html#source-data&quot;&gt;data for this project&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see “No Sources Found” for the demographic attributes of artists that could not be linked to a known person. The methodology page also has notes on &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/streaming-service-demographic-analysis.html#unknown-composers&quot;&gt;how unknown artists were handled in the analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; whose entire career is designed around providing the kind of algorithmically-friendly music favoured by mood playlists, to artists like Elena Kats-Chernin, who frequently work with orchestras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alexis-ffrench-together-at-last-bluebird&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench: Together At Last; Bluebird&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ffrench&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench&lt;/a&gt; (born 1970) is a British classical soul pioneer, composer, producer and pianist. Not only is Ffrench the UK’s biggest selling pianist of 2020, he has headlined London’s Royal Albert Hall, collaborated with fashion houses Miyake and Hugo Boss, played Latitude Festival, worked with Paloma Faith, composed several film scores and shares the same management team as Little Mix and Niall Horan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appearance #2 for Ffrench, whose &lt;em&gt;A Time for Giving&lt;/em&gt; was featured on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html#alexis-ffrench-a-time-for-giving&quot;&gt;Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;The A-List: Classical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The first of these two songs, &lt;em&gt;Together At Last&lt;/em&gt;, is the titular song from Ffrench’s 2018 holiday EP. Like &lt;em&gt;A Time for Giving&lt;/em&gt;, which is from Ffrench’s 2020 holiday EP, &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;, it reminds me of the church music influences that Ffrench has spoken about in his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, &lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt;, is far and away Ffrench’s most popular song, and in my comments about the Apple Music playlist, I linked to a great performance of it from the BRIT awards. It reminds me in so many good ways of &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; from Michael Giacchino’s soundtrack to &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; — the sighing phrases, the gentle piano, the sense of time looping and passing at the same time. It’s really excellent. &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To make sure, I went to listen to &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; again, and this has tangentially inspired me with a business idea for orchestras:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone who has seen &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; will be unable to listen to &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; without being brought to tears, or at least this is my personal experience. It’s a masterpiece of modern cinema, packing an incredible amount of emotional affect into a very short number of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now, the last time I went to see a Pops program about film scores, &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; was not on it, which is surely a crime, but also an incredible missed opportunity. Much like you can shore up a financially deficient theme park in &lt;em&gt;Rollercoaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt; by jacking up the price of umbrellas when it rains, every orchestra should put &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; just before intermission and then have the ushers sell packets of tissues for $5 each on the way out to the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;OK, OK, so in the current context of there still very much being a global pandemic, maybe encouraging everyone to nose trumpet for revenue is a bad idea health-wise. But when COVID-19 is finally over and dead in the ground (dear lord, one day soon I hope), this is the path back to financial stability that all orchestras should surely take.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, my point is that &lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt; is a really good song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;amy-beach-berceuse-lullaby-no-2-from-three-compositions-op-40&quot;&gt;Amy Beach: Berceuse (Lullaby), No. 2 from Three Compositions, Op. 40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Beach&quot;&gt;Amy Marcy Cheney Beach&lt;/a&gt; (September 5, 1867 – December 27, 1944) was an American composer and pianist. She was the first successful American female composer of large-scale art music. Her “Gaelic” Symphony, premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. She was one of the first American composers to succeed without the benefit of European training, and one of the most respected and acclaimed American composers of her era. As a pianist, she was acclaimed for concerts she gave featuring her own music in the United States and in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another second appearance: Beach’s &lt;em&gt;Young Birches, Op. 128&lt;/em&gt; were featured on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#amy-beach-young-birches-op-128-no-2&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The song title doesn’t really make it clear (the track in the playlist is from a lullaby compilation album), but this is the second movement from a trio, which you can listen to on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/24nOyX4MeANGSsKhYclqDa?si=Ekwz695wRRGbpme2rf2j6w&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;album from the Klugherz-Timmons Duo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nadje-noordhuis-bluebird&quot;&gt;Nadje Noordhuis: Bluebird&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Described as “one of the most compelling voices to emerge on her instrument in recent years” (Dan Bilawksy, All about Jazz), Australian-born New York based trumpeter/composer Nadje Noordhuis possesses one of the most unforgettably lyrical voices in modern music. Her deeply-felt, clarion tone and evocative compositional gift meld classical rigor, jazz expression, and world music accents into a sound that is distinctively her own. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nadjenoordhuis.com/about-1&quot;&gt;Personal Website Biography&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second song called &lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt; on this playlist. One interesting thing they both have in common is that the piano is mic’d in such a way that you can hear the sounds of the sustain pedal and other moving parts click and thud in the background. It’s an interesting feature of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://switchedonpop.com/episodes/why-lo-fi-is-the-perfect-background-music&quot;&gt;lo-fi production&lt;/a&gt; you can find on many mood-themed playlists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the real jewel of this track is the trumpet performance. Noordhuis plays with a lovely warm tone and is able to effortlessly glide into and out of silence in certain phrases. If you like this track, I’d recommend you check out the whole album, which is titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/7k6LMeVKzWrL9XHzNTPkXu?si=9RwJMxm6Sa-pDQ6A-w4nGQ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten Sails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-digression-about-metadata&quot;&gt;A Digression About Metadata&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing about this song is that it illustrates an issue that has been frequently discussed about Spotify and other streaming platforms. At a high level, a song has two sets of rights, which result in two types of revenue streams. First, there is the “master” right to the recording itself, and second, there are the “publishing” rights for the music composition. When you stream a track on Apple Music or Spotify, both sets of rightsholders need to be paid. However, especially for publishing rightsholders (e.g. a composer or songwriter), the data that tells the streaming service who to pay is often missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; problem. In a recent review, the UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee heard that there are billions of dollars unallocated due to bad data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At best, mismatched, incomplete or missing metadata can result in delays to creator royalties for months or even years. At worst, this can result in payments being misallocated or otherwise consigned as unclaimed or non-attributable royalties to ‘black boxes’. Black boxes consisted of $2.5 billion in unallocated income in 2019 alone. &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 93, page 51. Sources in original.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The original source for the $2.5 billion figure was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/08/03/music-industry-royalty-black-box/&quot;&gt;2017 article by Digital Music News&lt;/a&gt; which cited figures provided by Paperchain, a tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, artists are able to get the data fixed and collect the income they are entitled to. However, the committee heard that most of the money goes elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After a period of time, black boxes are then assigned pro-rata to streams that have been correctly identified, which is established in standard publishing agreements. This means that those creators and companies, particularly who are most listened to, are effectively are [sic] paid twice: first for their own streams, and then for streams that cannot be allocated. &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 93, page 51. Sources in original.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. “Economics of Music Streaming: Second Report of Session 2021–22.” London, United Kingdom: House of Commons, July 9, 2021. &lt;a href=&quot;https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6739/documents/72525/default/&quot;&gt;https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6739/documents/72525/default/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons this problem persists, including the need to digitize paper records for back catalogues, and limitations on who can submit corrections or challenges to bad data. However, a big part of the problem is lack of effort from record labels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the recording and song rights are licensed separately and often held by different music creators and companies, many labels do not supply the relevant ISWC &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;International Standard Musical Works Code, a unique identifier used to help identify the correct rightsholders.&lt;/span&gt;
 when licensing music to streaming services, meaning that songwriters often lose out altogether when music is streamed. Often, this is by choice because of the difficulty of doing so: in oral evidence, Maria Forte asserted that in conversation with one record label, a representative said “‘I don’t care about composer information because it’s nothing to do with me. I’m not changing my system to do that’”. &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 90, page 50. Sources in original.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. “Economics of Music Streaming: Second Report of Session 2021–22.” London, United Kingdom: House of Commons, July 9, 2021. &lt;a href=&quot;https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6739/documents/72525/default/&quot;&gt;https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6739/documents/72525/default/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, there is a mismatch of responsibility and incentive. The record label earns its income from owning the master rights to a song. However, it is responsible for supplying the data that identifies the master rights holder(s) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the publishing rights holder(s) when the song is uploaded. As a result, the master rights data is usually correct, but the publishing rights data is often incorrect or omitted, unless the record label has a financial stake in ensuring the publishing rights data is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent example of this — when the song was originally uploaded to Spotify, the songwriter credit for Nadje Noordhuis was missing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Screen Shot 2021-09-18 at 4.30.30 PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Spotify &amp;quot;Show Credits&amp;quot; dialog box. &amp;quot;Written by&amp;quot; is blank.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at the time, songwriter credits for Nadje’s collaborator, Luke Howard, &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; included on the same album. The label, Lukktone, appears to be owned or controlled by Luke Howard (since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discogs.com/label/792716-Lukktone&quot;&gt;all of its releases feature him as an artist&lt;/a&gt;). I’m not accusing anyone here of malice — it just illustrates the broader issue: Lukktone had a strong financial incentive to ensure that the songwriter credits for Luke Howard were correctly submitted; it had less of an incentive to ensure that the credits for Nadje Noordhuis were also correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this particular story has a positive ending. At some point between September and October 2021, the credits were corrected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Screen Shot 2021-10-31 at 12.17.23 PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Spotify &amp;quot;Show Credits&amp;quot; dialog box. &amp;quot;Written by&amp;quot; lists &amp;quot;Nadje Noordhuis-Fairfax&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even still, this album was released in 2015, which means that at best, Nadja Noordhuis will be receiving a couple thousand dollars in publishing revenue &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;It’s hard to estimate exactly, but you could extrapolate from the average master right payout and take a guess at what the publishing revenue might be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USD $0.004 per-stream master right payment × (15% publishing / 55% master) × 4,200,000 streams × 50% revenue share with publisher ≈ $2,300
&lt;/span&gt; for a song that’s been streamed over 4 million times on Spotify — six years late.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kats-Chernin&quot;&gt;Elena Kats-Chernin&lt;/a&gt; AO (born 4 November 1957) is a Soviet-born Australian pianist and composer, best known for her ballet &lt;em&gt;Wild Swans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I would describe the vibe of this song as “Pull up a chair and get comfortable. I’m about to tell you a long story, starting from the beginning.” Perhaps I should have suggested you listen to this before the metadata digression above. If I had a piano in my house, I would definitely learn how to play this; if you want to learn how to play it, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Kats-Chernin-Elena-Lullaby-for-Nick-Violin-Piano-Digital-Sheet-Music/2498011&quot;&gt;buy the sheet music from Boosey &amp;amp; Hawkes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Orchestra 100&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;If Average US Orchestra&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Tracks&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;2 (2.0%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;People of Colour&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;2 (2.0%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women of Colour&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Living&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;8 (8.0%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, given Apple Music’s stronger UI and metadata for classical music, it didn’t have an equivalent first party “all-orchestra” playlist like this one. In a sense, this should be the most comparable playlist to the average US orchestra season since it only focuses on orchestral repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#classical-essentials&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this playlist has significantly fewer composers who are women or people of colour compared to the average US orchestra season, and no women of colour composers at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;heitor-villa-lobos-choros-no-8&quot;&gt;Heitor Villa-Lobos: Choros No. 8&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heitor_Villa-Lobos&quot;&gt;Heitor Villa-Lobos&lt;/a&gt; (March 5, 1887 – November 17, 1959) was a Brazilian composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist described as “the single most significant creative figure in 20th-century Brazilian art music”. Villa-Lobos has become the best-known South American composer of all time. A prolific composer, he wrote numerous orchestral, chamber, instrumental and vocal works, totaling over 2000 works by his death in 1959.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a larger series of pieces named after chôro, “music played by an ensemble of Brazilian street musicians (called chorões) using both African and European instruments, who improvise in a free and often dissonant kind of counterpoint called contracanto.” &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B4ros&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chôros&lt;/em&gt; on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 I’m quite fond of the fact that the beginning sounds a bit like the warm-up that happens onstage before most concerts start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Villa-Lobos is played much less often by US orchestras now than during his late lifetime. In his 1951 book “The American Symphony Orchestra: A Social History of Musical Taste”, John H. Mueller wrote “Among the composers [of Latin America], Villa-Lobos of Brazil is the most noted and enjoys a statistically perceptible rank in the repertoire.” &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;Page 265.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanorchestras.org/learn/artistic-planning/orchestra-repertoire-report/&quot;&gt;League of American Orchestras Repertoire Reports&lt;/a&gt; note only two programs featuring pieces by Villa-Lobos in 2012/13 and no programs in 2011/12. The Institute for Composer Diversity analysis from 2019/20 (which included slightly more than twice as many orchestras compared to the League reports) notes eight performances of pieces by Villa-Lobos. The only major symphony featured in either source was Oregon, who included Villa-Lobos’ &lt;em&gt;Uirapurú&lt;/em&gt; in their 2019/20 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the explanation may be related to US foreign policy? It’s possible that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Neighbor_policy&quot;&gt;Good Neighbour Policy&lt;/a&gt; espoused by President Roosevelt contributed to interest in South American composers; in turn, after the fall of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas in 1945, Villa-Lobos was able to travel again, and his Wikipedia page notes that he “made regular visits to the United States”. If I can find an analysis of US orchestral repertoire that follows on from the time period of Mueller’s book, it would be interesting to see if there was a decline in performances of Villa-Lobos’ work brought on by a return to more interventionist South American US foreign policy with the onset of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other fun comment on Villa-Lobos from Mueller’s book: in a section about audience reactions, he writes about how the tastes of conductor Leopold Stokowski were sometimes at odds with those of his audience. A Schoenberg performance apparently elicited a “shower of forthright hisses” from the audience, after which Stokowski “turned to his audience and defensively pleaded freedom of expression for the artist.” Mueller then tactfully notes that “Those who agreed with him applauded; those who preferred freedom of expression for the audience made known their opinions by a contrary sign.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stokowski later performed this piece—Chorôs No. 8—resulting in a similar audience reaction. Presumably having learned that arguing with the audience did no good, “on this occasion [Stokowski] invited the disaffected members of the audience to leave “and smoke the classic cigarette.”” &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;Page 359 of &lt;em&gt;The American Symphony Orchestra: A Social History of Musical Taste&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final note: I recently discovered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3jvrf0brPEohaxmFHffZGM?si=YbyASROJTk6RiGjFaDCvyQ&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;album of Villa-Lobos Choral Transcriptions&lt;/a&gt; performed by the São Paulo Symphony Choir and Valentina Peleggi and really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend you give it a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toru-takemitsu-a-flock-descends-into-the-pentagonal-garden&quot;&gt;Toru Takemitsu: A Flock Descends Into the Pentagonal Garden&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dru_Takemitsu&quot;&gt;Tōru Takemitsu&lt;/a&gt; (武満 徹, Takemitsu Tōru, October 8, 1930 – February 20, 1996) was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu was admired for the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is known for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy and for fusing sound with silence and tradition with innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I’ve listened to this one several times, and I don’t think I like it; it’s too abstract for my tastes. It seems to be one of Takemitsu’s more well-known pieces for Orchestra, and one of the ones I had heard of already before doing this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do like this style of music, then let me shill for my employer and recommend you check out an &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3BFaA08GIWtZlfKdUxDIHu?si=2jf4L9brS7-fKsUKxDFZ7w&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;album of four of Takemitsu’s early orchestra pieces&lt;/a&gt; from 1969, with the TSO conducted by then-Music Director Seiji Ozawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;louise-farrenc-symphony-no-3-in-g-minor-op-36-i-adagio---allegro&quot;&gt;Louise Farrenc: Symphony No. 3 in G Minor, Op. 36: I. Adagio - Allegro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Farrenc&quot;&gt;Louise Farrenc&lt;/a&gt; (née Jeanne-Louise Dumont; 31 May 1804 – 15 September 1875) was a French composer, virtuoso pianist and teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second piece we’ve looked at by Farrenc; the third movement from her Nonet in E-Flat Major, Op. 38 was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#louise-farrenc-nonet-in-e-flat-major-op-38-iii-scherzo-vivace&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt; playlist&lt;/a&gt;. This symphony was written two years earlier than the Nonet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By self-admission, Farrenc’s Symphony No. 3 is the only symphony by a female composer on Tom Service’s 2014 Guardian series on “50 Greatest Symphonies”. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jun/24/symphony-guide-louise-farrenc-third-symphony-tom-service&quot;&gt;Service’s article on Farrenc’s symphony&lt;/a&gt;, he says the final movement is his favourite. I think mine is the first — the boisterous theme that comes after the slow lead-in is a top-tier example of “big C” classical drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-commercial-recordings&quot;&gt;The Role of Commercial Recordings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his article, Service noted that there were only two commercial recordings of Farrenc’s Symphony No. 3: one from the North German Radio Philharmonic (the one featured on this playlist) and another from the Orchestre de Bretagne. Two more recordings have since been made by the Solistes Européens, Luxembourg in 2018 &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;From their bio, it seems like the Solistes Européens, Luxembourg claim to be the NBA all star team of European orchestras, but maybe that’s just marketing.&lt;/span&gt;
 and very recently by the Insula Orchestra in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to watch how the availability of commercial recordings has started to catch up with changes in orchestra programming to feature more diverse composers. For example, Florence Price became a household name for many orchestras in 2020/21, while at the same time only her first symphony had more than one recording. Now, as of September 24, Deutche Grammophon is releasing a recording of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.umusic.ca/press-releases/yannick-nezet-seguin-the-philadelphia-orchestra-announce-new-album-florence-price-symphonies-nos-1-3/&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Orchestra playing symphonies 1 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. There’s still only the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2EKqIZNOAbDdk4F1gL56Wh?si=65OzboWRSyiCotqOY3pANQ&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;recording of Symphony No. 4 by the Fort Smith Symphony&lt;/a&gt;, but hopefully more are on their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some gaps to fill: earlier in the year I did some back-of-the-napkin math, and about one-third of the most-played orchestra pieces by women composers have no commercial recordings at all; most notably Missy Mazzoli’s &lt;em&gt;Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres)&lt;/em&gt;, although you can find some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyJt0aSnP8&quot;&gt;recorded performances of it on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe this is a small part of the puzzle — even if you had curators at Spotify and Apple Music whose programming choices were more in line with the average US orchestra, there are still a sizeable number of pieces that aren’t in the catalogue yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kaija-saariaho-du-cristal&quot;&gt;Kaija Saariaho: Du Cristal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaija_Saariaho&quot;&gt;Kaija Anneli Saariaho&lt;/a&gt; (Finnish: [ˈkɑi̯jɑ ˈsɑːriɑho]; née Laakkonen; born 14 October 1952) is a Finnish composer based in Paris, France. … In a 2019 composers’ poll by BBC Music Magazine, Saariaho was ranked the greatest living composer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Saariaho studied composition in Helsinki, Freiburg, and Paris, where she has lived since 1982. Her research at the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music (IRCAM) marked a turning point in her music away from strict serialism towards spectralism. Her characteristically rich, polyphonic textures are often created by combining live music and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like “A Flock Descends…” this one is also a bit abstract for my tastes, though I find myself liking it more, and I would definitely be interested in hearing it live. In particular, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://saariaho.org/works/du-cristal/&quot;&gt;description on Saariaho’s website&lt;/a&gt; mentions that the piece has “an important part for synthesizer” which isn’t immediately obvious to me; &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;If I were to guess, I think you can hear it around 11:00?&lt;/span&gt;
 maybe being able to see the synth player press the keys would be a good clue as to which sounds are analogue and which are digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piece is actually a two-parter of sorts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://saariaho.org/works/a-la-fumee/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;…à la Fumée&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is meant to follow, though it’s clear that Saariaho thinks that each can stand alone, and in fact they were each commissioned for two different orchestras. Like with &lt;em&gt;Du Cristal&lt;/em&gt;, there’s an electronic element to &lt;em&gt;à la Fumée&lt;/em&gt;, with electronically modified alto flute and cello soloists. There were a couple moments where the solo instruments sounded like they were using an effect or filter, but like with &lt;em&gt;Du Cristal&lt;/em&gt;, it’s very subtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the difference in how I feel about this piece compared to “A Flock Descends…” is that despite both being abstract (by which I mean neither has any clear melody), &lt;em&gt;Du Cristal&lt;/em&gt; feels like it has a clearer structure created by the differences in intensity and instrumentation, whereas I don’t think the musical ideas in “A Flock Descends…” come together in a way that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. I will admit, in both cases, I like each piece a little more after every repeat listen, so who knows, maybe after two dozen plays, I’ll change my mind and think “A Flock Descends…” is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;up-next&quot;&gt;Up Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m increasingly adding long digressions to these deep dives, it seems like I’m going to have to get through the rest of the Spotify tracks one playlist at a time. Up next is &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, where there are some interesting connections to wider conversations about streaming platforms, including metadata and how artists get paid, and the whole universe of streaming-first artists fostered by Spotify. In-between the digressions, there will also be interesting music to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playlist-methodology-and-data&quot;&gt;Playlist, Methodology, and Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can listen to all of the pieces featured in this playlist analysis series here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6vQwkvRqWbGEF5IKZmC6na?si=1829c2da26b84f03&quot;&gt;Spotify: Classical Deep Dive - Spotify &amp;amp; Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/MW Concerts Format 19-20 with legend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visualization showing the length of pieces in Toronto Symphony MasterWorks Concerts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making it, it occurred to me that this kind of diagram would be useful to demonstrate other attributes of an orchestra season, especially some of the qualitative aspects of composer representation (which were discussed in that post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the original diagram, I built a stacked bar chart in excel, and then coloured each piece according to their category manually. It worked once as a proof of concept, but was way too cumbsersome a method to use repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-attempts&quot;&gt;Initial Attempts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to simplify the creation process, I first tried to see if could make the chart in R using &lt;a href=&quot;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/&quot;&gt;ggplot&lt;/a&gt;. However, I wasn’t able to assign colours using values that were unrelated to those invovled in creating the stacked bar chart itself. Perhaps this is possible, but I don’t know ggplot that well, so I wasn’t able to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also interested in interactivity (e.g. being able to click one of the bar segments and see information about which piece it represents), so I tried making a stacked bar chart using DataWrapper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Season Vis&quot; aria-label=&quot;Stacked Bars&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-xQNLw&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xQNLw/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;224&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var e in a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.getElementById(&quot;datawrapper-chart-&quot;+e)||document.querySelector(&quot;iframe[src*='&quot;+e+&quot;']&quot;);t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][e]+&quot;px&quot;)}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; well as a proof of concept. However, it still had a number of drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no way to show piece information on click&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hard to distinguish between data elements with the same colour (see the two symphonies in Concert B)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cumbersome to make for datasets of any complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain the last point: the colour formatting is applied per-column, so to do the chart properly, you need to create a column for each unique combination of a piece’s position and category. If you download the data from the chart, you’ll see that the chart uses nine columns, because there are three pieces on each program multiplied by three potential categories for each piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also makes the interactivity a bit odd - you’ll notice if you hover over the opening fanfare in Concert A, the opening fanfare in Concert C is also highlighted, because they’re both in the same column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, having tested a couple of potentially-simpler options, I decided to take the plunge and make my own app to generate season visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-visualization-tool&quot;&gt;Building the Visualization Tool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Datawrapper test didn’t do exactly what I was looking for, examining how they structured the chart helped me figure out how to set up the styling and structure for the chart I wanted to make. After a bit of reverse engineering, I was able to make a HTML prototype of what the end result should look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Structure Prototype&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/structurePrototype.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;270&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, I decided to make a client-side app (i.e. it just runs in the browser, no need for a server) since it seemed simple, safe, and could be hosted for free via github. Before this point, I had dabbled in Javascript to do simple things, like giving website viewers the choice to load an embedded spotify player, or making fancy footnotes. This project, unsurprisingly, was quite a bit harder, but I learned quite a lot by making it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’ve done data manipulation before, I’ve usually used python/pandas or R. In comparison, Javascript is… less good. A couple examples that came to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sort this 2D data by its second column:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pandas: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dataframe.sort_values('col2')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;array.sort((a,b) =&amp;gt; a[1] - b[1])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me the second column from this 2D data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pandas: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dataframe['col2']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;array.map(a =&amp;gt; a[1])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so maybe comparing base Javascript to a python data analysis library isn’t fair. Let’s do something basic, language to language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round this number to two decimal places:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;python: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;round(1.2345, 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Math.round(1.2345 * 100) / 100&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back on track, the major milestones I remember include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning how to parse CSV data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.papaparse.com/&quot;&gt;Papa Parse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generating a graph from the CSV data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making a system to style and customize the graph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using bootstrap to make the app pretty without trying very hard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making a proper system for the user to match the CSV data to the values needed to generate the chart&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generating embeddable code that can be copied into blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After putting all those pieces together, I was able to make a beta version of the app to start generating charts for blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the beta (or any improved versions that may come later) on github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tallcoleman/orchestra-season-visualization&quot;&gt;github.com/tallcoleman/orchestra-season-visualization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The live app can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://osv.tallcoleman.me&quot;&gt;osv.tallcoleman.me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end-result&quot;&gt;The End Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the new version in all its glory - you can now use the Explore button to navigate around the chart and see the composer name and title for each piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;function alertsize(pixels, iframeID){pixels+=5;document.getElementById(iframeID).style.height=pixels+&quot;px&quot;;}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-74528596&quot; title=&quot;Concert Format: TSO 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/tso1920formatTTI.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made another version for fun, where the concerts are sorted by date instead of time to intermission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;function alertsize(pixels, iframeID){pixels+=5;document.getElementById(iframeID).style.height=pixels+&quot;px&quot;;}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-15688531&quot; title=&quot;Concert Format: TSO 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/tso1920formatCT.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to using this in future posts - I have a couple data sets lined up already.

&lt;p&gt;To recap quickly from &lt;a href=&quot;/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html&quot;&gt;my last post going through the Apple Music playlists&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My goal for this blog series was to write about ways to explore and enjoy orchestral music. So, as part of going over the Spotify and Apple Music stats in detail, I wanted to highlight the small number of composers in each playlist that were women, Black, Indigenous, and/or people of colour. This way, you can discover more about them and get to know their music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve just landed here, or haven’t read the Apple Music post, make sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html#using-201920-orchestra-seasons-as-a-benchmark&quot;&gt;the notes explaining the “Average US Orchestra” comparator&lt;/a&gt; I’m using below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spotify&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representation of composers on Spotify was a bit better than on Apple Music, especially for composers of colour. The other thing that is notably different between the two platforms is that Spotify has historically had a much stronger focus on mood-themed playlists, so there are more streaming-first artists in some of the playlists I examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;classical-essentials&quot;&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;If Average US Orchestra&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Tracks&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;172&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;7 (4.1%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Black / People of Colour&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;3 (1.7%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women of Colour&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Living&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;20 (11.6%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html#classical-essentials&quot;&gt;equivalent playlist on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, Spotify &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt; has a slightly higher representation of women composers, and actually has some composers who are Black or people of colour. The proportion of living composers is also significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;samuel-coleridge-taylor-symphonic-variations-on-an-african-air-op63&quot;&gt;Samuel Coleridge-Taylor: Symphonic Variations on an African Air, Op.63&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Coleridge-Taylor&quot;&gt;Samuel Coleridge-Taylor&lt;/a&gt; (15 August 1875 – 1 September 1912) was an English composer and conductor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of mixed race birth, Coleridge-Taylor achieved such success that he was referred to by white New York musicians as the “African Mahler” when he had three tours of the United States in the early 1900s. He was particularly known for his three cantatas on the epic poem, Song of Hiawatha by American Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Coleridge-Taylor premiered the first section in 1898, when he was 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to write a whole post on this piece at some point. There are a lot of interesting choices to make in a theme and variations format and I think Coleridge-Taylor does a good job of transforming a spiritual (&lt;em&gt;I’m Troubled in Mind&lt;/em&gt;) into several different styles of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to listen to a version of the source material, you can check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POSaaCOJiq0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recording by the Southern University Quartet&lt;/a&gt;. Also important to note that &lt;em&gt;I’m Troubled in Mind&lt;/em&gt; is not the same as &lt;em&gt;Trouble In Mind&lt;/em&gt;, which is a blues standard, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_in_Mind_(song)#Lyrics_and_composition&quot;&gt;it seems like the two songs are related&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;astor-piazzolla-libertango&quot;&gt;Astor Piazzolla: Libertango&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_Piazzolla&quot;&gt;Astor Pantaleón Piazzolla&lt;/a&gt; (March 11, 1921 – July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed Nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will perhaps be unsurprised to learn that this song by  “the world’s foremost composer of Tango music” will make you want to dance. The track on Spotify is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/0mcgXc8P5GyGtP9aY7zir6?si=hWvtm1sbQcarPSoTJbBfgg&quot;&gt;trumpet version by Alison Balsom&lt;/a&gt; but I also highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIN3IE3DHqc&quot;&gt;Grace Jones’ cover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;takashi-yoshimatsu-saxophone-concerto-op-59-cyber-bird-i-bird-in-colors-allegro&quot;&gt;Takashi Yoshimatsu: Saxophone Concerto, Op. 59, “Cyber-bird”: I. Bird in Colors: Allegro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Yoshimatsu&quot;&gt;Takashi Yoshimatsu&lt;/a&gt; (吉松 隆, Yoshimatsu Takashi) (born March 18, 1953) is a contemporary Japanese composer of classical music. He is well known for composing the 2003 remake of Astro Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/infographic-the-hierarchy-of-solo-instruments.aspx&quot;&gt;The majority of concertos performed are for piano, violin, and to a slightly lesser extent, cello&lt;/a&gt;. So I would absolutely buy tickets to see this, especially with a name as cool as “Cyber Bird”. It’s an excellent concerto. Also: Yoshimatsu has a bird-themed album with fantastic cover art. How could I not be a fan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Cover Art - Yoshimatsu Symphonic Exhibition of Birds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tori no Kyohten - Symphonic Exhibition of Birds&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jess-gillam-merry-christmas-mr-lawrence-arr-metcalfe&quot;&gt;Jess Gillam: Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (Arr. Metcalfe)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Gillam&quot;&gt;Jess Gillam&lt;/a&gt; (born 24 May 1998) is a British saxophonist and BBC radio broadcaster from Ulverston, Cumbria. Gillam hosts This Classical Life on BBC Radio 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I spent too much time in high school band, but I don’t usually think of Saxophone as a “light and airy” instrument. A really incredible performance here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germaine-tailleferre-string-quartet-i-modere&quot;&gt;Germaine Tailleferre: String Quartet: I. Modere&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaine_Tailleferre&quot;&gt;Germaine Tailleferre&lt;/a&gt; (born Marcelle Germaine Taillefesse; 19 April 1892 – 7 November 1983) was a French composer and the only female member of the group of composers known as Les Six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The melodies in this quartet are a little abstract for my taste, but I do really like how it feels like a story told through a number of sometimes-complex emotional states. The history of &lt;em&gt;Les Six&lt;/em&gt; is also pretty fascinating, including their role in popularizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Boeuf_sur_le_Toit_(cabaret)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Boeuf sur le Toit&lt;/em&gt;, a bar that was “the epicenter of the Paris of the Roaring Twenties”&lt;/a&gt;. This bar apparently originated the French expression for musicians to jam together: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english-french/jam&quot;&gt;“faire un boeuf”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nadia-boulanger-3-pieces-for-cello-and-piano-no-1-modere&quot;&gt;Nadia Boulanger: 3 Pieces for cello and piano: No. 1. Modere&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Boulanger&quot;&gt;Juliette Nadia Boulanger&lt;/a&gt; (16 September 1887 – 22 October 1979) was a French composer, conductor, and teacher. She is notable for having taught many of the leading composers and musicians of the 20th century. She also performed occasionally as a pianist and organist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is really beautiful, and it makes excellent use of the cello’s upper range. The other two parts of the &lt;em&gt;3 Pieces&lt;/em&gt; are also worth a listen: #2 is lyrical and sweet, and #3 is energetic and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadia’s &lt;em&gt;Lux Aeterna&lt;/em&gt; was also featured on the &lt;a href=&quot;/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html#lili-boulanger--nadia-boulanger-lux-aeterna-for-voice-harp-violin-and-cello&quot;&gt;Apple Music Classical Essentials playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;louise-farrenc-nonet-in-e-flat-major-op-38-iii-scherzo-vivace&quot;&gt;Louise Farrenc: Nonet in E-Flat Major, Op. 38: III. Scherzo. Vivace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Farrenc&quot;&gt;Louise Farrenc&lt;/a&gt; (née Jeanne-Louise Dumont; 31 May 1804 – 15 September 1875) was a French composer, virtuoso pianist and teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine is an interesting number of musicians to have — you can blur the line between chamber and small-orchestra music. Farrenc’s Nonet, which uses the most common instrumentation of combining a wind quintet with a string quartet (with a double bass instead of a second violin) is essentially a symphony, with fewer players. She wrote it after already completing three symphonies, and I think it shows in her talented use of form and different instrumental voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to this made me think about one of the things that’s interesting about orchestral music, which is that instruments can serve so many different roles during one piece. Sometimes it’s establishing rhythm, sometimes it’s providing harmony, sometimes it’s playing the melody, and other times it’s playing for accent or effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jessica-curry-finding-the-pattern&quot;&gt;Jessica Curry: Finding the Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Curry&quot;&gt;Jessica Curry&lt;/a&gt; (born c. 1973) is an English composer, radio presenter and former co-head of the British video game development studio The Chinese Room. She won a BAFTA award in 2016 for her score for the video game &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most popular track from the &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture&lt;/em&gt; video game (on Spotify anyway). I’ll have to ask my girlfriend nicely to borrow her Windows computer so I can play this game. Several of the reviews I read about it mention how good the music is and how well it was used to emphasize emotional moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must have been bittersweet to win a BAFTA after &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160402170520/http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/blog/blog/why-im-sort-of-leaving-the-chinese-room&quot;&gt;announcing she would be distancing herself from The Chinese Room&lt;/a&gt; because of her health and because her experiences as a woman in the video game industry were so awful. However, judging by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jessicacurry.co.uk/&quot;&gt;the projects listed on her website&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like she was successful in broadening her music-making beyond video games, with a number of interesting standalone pieces and commissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After The Chinese Room went through a rebirth and new ownership, Curry composed music for their 2020 game, &lt;em&gt;Little Orpheus&lt;/em&gt;, which was released on Apple Arcade. Unfortunately, like with &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture&lt;/em&gt;, I don’t have the right device to play it: my iPhone is too old &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;My iPhone 6 has had a longer useful life than the Nokia brick I had as a teenager, which is pretty impressive. I’m going to hold on to that headphone jack for as long as I can.&lt;/span&gt;, and I haven’t upgraded my mac to Catalina yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;amy-beach-young-birches-op-128-no-2&quot;&gt;Amy Beach: Young Birches, Op. 128, No. 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Beach&quot;&gt;Amy Marcy Cheney Beach&lt;/a&gt; (September 5, 1867 – December 27, 1944) was an American composer and pianist. She was the first successful American female composer of large-scale art music. Her “Gaelic” Symphony, premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. She was one of the first American composers to succeed without the benefit of European training, and one of the most respected and acclaimed American composers of her era. As a pianist, she was acclaimed for concerts she gave featuring her own music in the United States and in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually part of a set of three nature-themed piano pieces (the other two are about a chipmunk and a hummingbird, respectively). I love program music and Amy Beach does a great job of capturing the essence of these animals and plants in this trio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;barbara-strozzi-amor-dormiglione&quot;&gt;Barbara Strozzi: Amor dormiglione&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Strozzi&quot;&gt;Barbara Strozzi&lt;/a&gt; (also called Barbara Valle; baptised 6 August 1619  – 11 November 1677) was an Italian singer and composer of the Baroque Period. During her lifetime, Strozzi published eight volumes of her own music, having more music in print than any other composer of the era. This was made possible without any support from the Church or consistent patronage of the nobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not usually a fan of Baroque music, but I like this piece. It has big folk song energy. Apparently the title means something along the lines of “sleepy cupid”; you can read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://barbarastrozzi.com/piece/amor-dormiglione/&quot;&gt;translation of the lyrics&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Strozzi is one of several women composers profiled in Anna Beer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://oneworld-publications.com/sounds-and-sweet-airs-pb.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sounds And Sweet Airs: The Forgotten Women Of Classical Music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a book I was able to read part of before having to return it to the library. I’ll have to take it out again soon and re-read the Strozzi chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-cant-make-up-for-missing-metadata&quot;&gt;AI can’t make up for missing metadata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s true about nearly all of the pieces listed here (but that I only noticed with the Amy Beach piece) — you can really see the effect of placement on an official playlist. Amy Beach’s &lt;em&gt;Young Birches&lt;/em&gt; has nearly 2 million plays, whereas &lt;em&gt;A Peterboro Chipmunk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Humming Bird&lt;/em&gt; only average about 2,000 each. Similar orders of magnitude can be found for the other tracks that are part of a larger work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a quick experiment, I tried looking through the song radio for some of the tracks on this playlist to see if the other movements would show up. In a couple cases they did (e.g. the second movement of Nadia Boulanger’s &lt;em&gt;3 Pieces&lt;/em&gt; is #11 on song radio for the first movement), but in most cases, the other movements from the same piece were absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of this may be due to the fact that Spotify has no metadata to describe multi-movement pieces of music (Apple Music does, which is why movements from the same symphony are grouped in their UI). Perhaps if they did, it would be a useful signal for song radio. Goodness knows - if they can generate a logistic variable for “danceability”, they can probably manage a field or two to indicate tracks that should be grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;up-next&quot;&gt;Up next&lt;/h2&gt;

(This is a big deal - Scrivener 3 for Mac came out in 2017 and there were times when it seemed like a Windows version might never ship.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrivener is designed really well for solo writing, but when it comes to collaborative writing and commenting, Google Docs is much, much better. This makes it ideal for grant writing, and I’ve had very few complaints using Google Docs as my main writing tool. However, there is one feature from Scrivener that would be really nice to have for grant writing: a way of setting a word count and word limit for each question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Scrivener Example.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the Scrivener application showing sections with word count targets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Scrivener’s outline view allows you to get a quick overview of how your writing is coming along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about Google Apps is that is has pretty extensive scripting support, so I was able to make a script to create wordcounts for each section in a document. You can find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tallcoleman/heading-word-counter&quot;&gt;script and its instructions on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, but I also made a quick demonstration video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;/assets/Videos/exampleclip.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, you can put a word limit in parentheses in the heading, and it will then add and update a word count within those parentheses as well. The word count also gets a highlight colour to serve as a quick visual indicator of how close you are to the word limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s a bit frustrating is that, unlike in Google Sheets, there’s no trigger you can set up in Google Docs to run the script after you make an edit. So the best I was able to do for now is to provide a menu to run the script on command; in addition, the script will run on a time trigger every minute. (Once per minute is as often as Apps Script allows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the trigger limitations, it works pretty well, and I’m going to try using it and try to make additional refinements over time. I’m also going to dig deeper into different word count algorithms so that I can make sure the word count used in the script handles some of the odd edge cases in the same way that Google Docs does. I’ve also encountered some cases where grant portals count words slightly differently than google docs, and it would be interesting to try to figure out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a session word count target as a writing motivator (another well-loved Scrivener feature), you can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/word_counter_max_for_google_docs/364683295233?hl=en&amp;amp;pann=docs_addon_widget&quot;&gt;Word Counter Max add-on&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like it would also be a pretty useful tool for grant writers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Programming" /><summary type="html">My girlfriend uses Scrivener for fiction writing, and I was recently checking out the features again because miraculously, Scrivener 3 was finally released for Windows and she bought it.

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this blog series was to write about ways to explore and enjoy orchestral music. So, as part of going over the Spotify and Apple Music stats in detail, I wanted to highlight the small number of composers in each playlist that were women, Black, Indigenous, and/or people of colour. This way, you can discover more about them and get to know their music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a really interesting range of artists featured on both streaming services, ranging from composers from as early as the 17th century to some modern musicians who have built careers in and around the streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-201920-orchestra-seasons-as-a-benchmark&quot;&gt;Using 2019/20 orchestra seasons as a benchmark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide a benchmark, each playlist below is compared to a hypothetical playlist where the number of composers who are women; Black, Indigenous, or people of colour; or both is proportional to how often these composers are programmed by the average US orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “average US orchestra” calculation is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;2019/20 season analysis of 120 US orchestras from the Institute for Composer Diversity&lt;/a&gt;. The ICD analysis found that only 7.9% of works on mainstage programs were by women composers, and only 5.6% were by composers from underrepresented racial, ethnic, or cultural heritages. A full summary of their findings is included in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Full ICD List&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;“Top 21” from ICD List &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Orchestras&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Works Programmed&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4075&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;1490&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;321 (7.9%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;104 (7.0%)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;BIPOC &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;**&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;236 (5.8%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;67 (4.5%)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;BIPOC Women&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;77 (1.9%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;24 (1.6%)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Living&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;658 (16.1%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;241 (16.2%)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;This subgroup of 21 of the largest US orchestras will come up later when I talk about the ICD analysis in more detail. It is the original group analyzed by the Baltimore Symphony for the 2014/15 season and the group that has continued to be analyzed by Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy from 2016/17 to the present.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;The designation used by the Institute for Composer Diversity is “Composers from Underrepresented Racial, Ethnic, or Cultural Heritages”. My understanding is that this comprises composers who are Black, Indigenous, or people of colour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#methodology&quot;&gt;More information about the methodology behind these numbers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Needs some fiddling with the CSS to make it work (e.g. H2 adds its own padding under the heading div) --&gt;
&lt;!-- also needs inclusion of footer; add to post template --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-warning&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;panel-warning panel-heading&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labels for Composers who are Black, Indigenous, or People of Colour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since the intention of the BIPOC acronym is to specifically highlight the unique experiences of Black and Indigenous people, and not to be a catch-all for people who are not white, I’ve only used it in acronym form when talking about a group that includes all of the identities the acronym implies and when the acronym is warranted due to space limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When talking about a group that does not include all the identities that BIPOC implies, I’ve written out the specific identities that are included. When talking about an individual artist, I’ve tried to use their specific identity, as they describe it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The NPR podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/transcripts/918418825&quot;&gt;Code Switch had a good episode on the BIPOC acronym&lt;/a&gt; and
the various opinions people have about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One important thing to note is that the labels used in the tables below only describe the specific identities of the composers actually featured in each playlist. However, the &lt;em&gt;Average US Orchestra&lt;/em&gt; numbers should always be understood to imply the potential for broader representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-music&quot;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Music is often seen as a streaming platform that cares more about the experience of classical music listeners. Their app does a better job of displaying pieces of music that have multiple movements, and their metadata is more suited to the genre. Unlike Spotify, &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/streaming-service-demographic-analysis.html#analysis&quot;&gt;they have a pretty reliable “composer” field for most tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this increased attention to the genre hasn’t resulted in composer representation that keeps up with the field, as you can see in the playlists examined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;classical-essentials&quot;&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;If Average US Orchestra&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Tracks&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;3 (3.0%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;People of Colour&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women of Colour&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Living&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4 (4.0%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are no composers of colour represented on this playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about all of the three women composers on this playlist is that they are partially known for having deep musical and personal relationships with another person: Fanny Mendelssohn with her brother Felix, Nadia Boulanger, with her sister Lili, and Clara Schumann with her husband Robert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fanny-mendelssohn-string-quartet-in-e-flat-major-i-adagio-ma-non-troppo&quot;&gt;Fanny Mendelssohn: String Quartet in E-Flat Major: I. Adagio ma non troppo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Mendelssohn&quot;&gt;Fanny Mendelssohn&lt;/a&gt; (14 November 1805 – 14 May 1847), later Fanny [Cäcilie] Mendelssohn Bartholdy and, after her marriage, Fanny Hensel, also referred to as Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, was a German composer and pianist of the early Romantic era. Her compositions include a piano trio, a piano quartet, an orchestral overture, four cantatas, more than 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 lieder, most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Although praised for her piano technique, she rarely gave public performances outside her family circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first movement of this string quartet is really good - I see why they chose it for the playlist. Apparently she never formally learned to play any string instruments, and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Mendelssohn#Compositions&quot;&gt;was self-deprecating about this particular piece&lt;/a&gt;, which I think is sad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works… After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, “I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lili-boulanger--nadia-boulanger-lux-aeterna-for-voice-harp-violin-and-cello&quot;&gt;Lili Boulanger &amp;amp; Nadia Boulanger: Lux Aeterna (For Voice, Harp, Violin And Cello)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Boulanger&quot;&gt;Juliette Nadia Boulanger&lt;/a&gt; (16 September 1887 – 22 October 1979) was a French composer, conductor, and teacher. She is notable for having taught many of the leading composers and musicians of the 20th century. She also performed occasionally as a pianist and organist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Boulanger&quot;&gt;Marie-Juliette Olga “Lili” Boulanger&lt;/a&gt; (21 August 1893 – 15 March 1918) was a French composer, and the first female winner of the Prix de Rome composition prize. Her older sister was the noted composer and composition teacher Nadia Boulanger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of this piece is quite interesting — in an article titled &lt;em&gt;Nadia and Lili Boulanger: Sister Composers&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Caroline Potter notes that &lt;em&gt;Lux Aeterna&lt;/em&gt; is the second version of the song; the first was &lt;em&gt;Cantique&lt;/em&gt;, a setting of a poem from a play named &lt;em&gt;Soeur Béatrice&lt;/em&gt; by Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
Potter, Caroline. “Nadia and Lili Boulanger: Sister Composers.” The Musical Quarterly, vol. 83, no. 4, 1999, pp. 536–556. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/742616. Accessed 24 Jan. 2021.
&lt;/span&gt; Dr. Potter observes that &lt;em&gt;Cantique&lt;/em&gt; is heavily influenced by Gabriel Fauré’s &lt;em&gt;Lydia&lt;/em&gt; and has very similar opening chords &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
The key difference between the openings of Fauré’s &lt;em&gt;Lydia&lt;/em&gt; and Boulanger’s &lt;em&gt;Cantique&lt;/em&gt;, according to Dr. Potter, is that Fauré used the Lydian mode as a musical pun.
&lt;/span&gt; Nadia Boulanger later re-orchestrated &lt;em&gt;Cantique&lt;/em&gt; and set it to the text of the &lt;em&gt;Lux Aeterna&lt;/em&gt; for a mass commemorating Lili’s (early) death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Apple Music credits the song to both sisters, this seems to be incorrect. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2011126201.html&quot;&gt;Library of Congress credits Nadia as the sole composer&lt;/a&gt;, though it notes that she intended to have her orchestration match Lili’s &lt;em&gt;Pie Jesu&lt;/em&gt; in the reworking of the song. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.223636&amp;amp;catNum=223636&amp;amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;amp;language=English&quot;&gt;liner notes for the album&lt;/a&gt; note that “Since 1918, Nadia’s &lt;em&gt;Lux Aeterna&lt;/em&gt; and Lili’s &lt;em&gt;Pie Jesu&lt;/em&gt; have been sung every 15th March at a memorial Mass in Paris”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Schumann&quot;&gt;Clara Josephine Schumann&lt;/a&gt; (née Wieck; 13 September 1819 – 20 May 1896) was a German pianist, composer and piano teacher. Regarded as one of the most distinguished pianists of the Romantic era, she exerted her influence over a 61-year concert career, changing the format and repertoire of the piano recital from displays of virtuosity to programs of serious works. She also composed solo piano pieces, a piano concerto (her Op. 7), chamber music, choral pieces, and songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like this piece, Isata Kanneh-Mason recorded a whole &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/7Jt7TzZQgrMsJgI7CPyApE?si=DPiJdpJoQ-qiRhorHxMP2A&quot;&gt;album of pieces by Clara Schumann&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, including this one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, no composers of colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researching both of the women composers featured on this playlist, I came across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swedishmusicalheritage.com/&quot;&gt;Swedish Musical Heritage Website&lt;/a&gt;, which is a project initiated by The Royal Swedish Academy of Music. Thanks to this site, you can read detailed biographies for both composers and even download a lot of their sheet music for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helena-munktell-kleines-trio-ii-andante-espressivo&quot;&gt;Helena Munktell: Kleines Trio: II. Andante espressivo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Munktell&quot;&gt;Helena Mathilda Munktell&lt;/a&gt; (24 November 1852 – 10 September 1919) was a Swedish composer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bis.se/helena-munktell-violin-sonata-dix-melodies-kleines-trio&quot;&gt;liner notes&lt;/a&gt;: “The third work on this disc is a small-scale piano trio, probably an early work and possibly composed for performance at one of the musical salons at the Munktell family home in Stockholm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no works by Munktell included in the League analysis of 120 US orchestra mainstage programs, however, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/7FyUzdTN1C8U1uekkOLsZU?si=su8cZTqpTtqCo16MNjNfOA&quot;&gt;2005 album of her orchestral works by the Gälve Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. An untapped opportunity for orchestras looking to increase the number of women on the program, perhaps. Despite the fact that I spent a lot of a &lt;a href=&quot;/music/2020/12/30/exploring-orchestral-music-race-gender-representation-composers.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; talking about how women and people of colour should be programmed more in the back half of orchestra programs, I think her symphonic poem &lt;em&gt;Bränningar&lt;/em&gt; (Breaking Waves) would make a great opener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;amanda-rontgen-maier-violin-sonata-in-b-minor-ii-andantino&quot;&gt;Amanda Rontgen-Maier: Violin Sonata in B Minor: II. Andantino&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_R%C3%B6ntgen-Maier&quot;&gt;Amanda Röntgen-Maier&lt;/a&gt; (20 February 1853 – 15 July 1894) was a Swedish violinist and composer. She was the first female graduate in music direction from the Royal College of Music in Stockholm in 1872.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite fact about this Sonata, according to her biography, is that when she submitted it to the Swedish Art Music Society, one of the three men who reviewed it suggested she change the slow movement. To which she basically said “no, I like it too much the way it is”. The result: “The sonata was printed without any alterations and published in 1878.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, Apple Music’s “A-List” playlists are where they program new releases. The kinds of music on this playlist range from new recordings of the kinds of classical composers you might see on an orchestra program to instrumental streaming artists who primarily make their living based on placement on mood-themed playlists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the two composers of colour that were featured on this playlist are in the latter category of musicians who have made careers primarily as streaming artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sofiane-pamart-san-francisco&quot;&gt;Sofiane Pamart: San Francisco&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofiane_Pamart&quot;&gt;Sofiane Pamart&lt;/a&gt; is a French pianist, based in Paris and originally from Hellemmes in the suburbs of Lille. He is known to the French public for breaking the elitist codes of classical piano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every track on Pamart’s &lt;em&gt;Planet Gold&lt;/em&gt; album is geographically-named, so consider this a fun way to get the thrill of travelling while staying safe at home. &lt;em&gt;San Francisco&lt;/em&gt; in particular I thought was pretty hypnotic and cinematic. It reminded me a lot of Christopher Larkin’s very popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-original-soundtrack&quot;&gt;Hollow Knight soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, which I think speaks to Pamart’s ability to create a strong sense of atmosphere that really fuels your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alexis-ffrench-a-time-for-giving&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench: A Time for Giving&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ffrench&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench&lt;/a&gt; (born 1970) is a British classical soul pioneer, composer, producer and pianist. Not only is Ffrench the UK’s biggest selling pianist of 2020, he has headlined London’s Royal Albert Hall, collaborated with fashion houses Miyake and Hugo Boss, played Latitude Festival, worked with Paloma Faith, composed several film scores and shares the same management team as Little Mix and Niall Horan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of the kinds of music my mum used to play on the piano while people were coming in to church. Which makes sense in a certain way — &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.voice-online.co.uk/article/im-always-trying-retain-spirituality-my-music&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench often talks about how he grew up playing the organ at church and the role that spirituality has in his music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like this song, you should also check out his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_YNupMR6A4&quot;&gt;performance of the Bluebird Suite with orchestra at the Classic BRIT Awards 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which also features South African singer Pretty Yende.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;streaming-artists-and-their-audience&quot;&gt;Streaming Artists and Their Audience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists who have been able to make a career on streaming platforms playing classical instruments often get asked in interviews some variant of a question “how do you feel about the fact that you’re not making &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; classical music?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the implication is that their talent is being wasted on an audience who is primarily assumed to be writing emails while listening, other times it’s a nastier implication that they make simple, uncomplicated music with little “high art” merit. I don’t think it’s a particularly fair or meaningful question, but I do find that the variety of responses that these artists give is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best answers seem to turn the question on its head: instead of being about “is your art valuable” (as judged by the existing gatekeepers), it becomes about the relationship each artist has with their audience, and the value that the audience gets from their music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://panm360.com/en/interviews-panm360/les-mondes-de-sofiane-pamart/&quot;&gt;Sofiane Pamart talks about this&lt;/a&gt; in a recent interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How do you respond to the classical purists, who remain unconvinced?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;… The important thing is to touch, to be moved. That goes beyond the technical repertoire. That comes later. It’s interesting to understand how an artist creates, but that comes later. I’m very happy to move away from that. If it does you good to tell you that there are winks at Debussy, I’m very happy, and if you have no classical references and it makes you think of film music or something else, I’m very comfortable with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/alexis-ffrench-interview-classical-music-needs-to-be-more-provocative-to-survive-a3866271.html&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench has a good answer too&lt;/a&gt;, I think:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Crucially, this means “breaking down perceived barriers”, therefore the power of the three-and-a-half-minute message should not be underestimated. “You can write 40-minute symphonies, but it’s more important to me to connect with people at this stage.” All of his singles on Spotify are under four minutes long and his new album is “tuneful,” despite many classical artists seeing this a “dirty word”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20210108_97760578?adh_i=&amp;amp;imai=&amp;amp;articlehash=CCA16B79E2A7BEBE80A47827F93058CF1FD977FAC79F5EF802575F1CBE816ED8D09D95989DDD769F6DBA00D6A10D290093FC25920ABB3BD55ECF2D337719A86D&quot;&gt;the most entertaining answer I found was from streaming artist Jef Martens&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it bother that the compositions you work so hard on are often listened to as background music?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘There are also Debussy arrangements, or pieces by Vikingur Olafsson. Just because people use them as a background doesn’t mean the music is bad. And apart from that: is one listener worth more than another? When I bring someone to a transcendental metaphysical insight with my music, I love it. And if I can help an official through his first tax check on a Monday morning, that’s fine.’

That’s the great thing about music: it can be enjoyed many different ways. Sometimes it can bring joy to your life in the background, and sometimes it can be an all-encompassing artistic experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.milana.ws/biography/&quot;&gt;Milana&lt;/a&gt; is a multi-award winning pianist, composer and singer-songwriter, who has been a performing and recording artist since her childhood. A strong lyricist and composer in her own right, Milana’s style is reminiscent of Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan, Michael Nyman, Keith Jarret and Chick Corea. Milana enjoys playing by ear, improvising and using whatever inspires her to create her own style of playing. She is known as an adept improviser, catching melodies on the fly and expanding them into her own creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of these 50, three of the tracks are nursery rhymes with no known composer, one did not have an identifiable composer listed (&lt;em&gt;Classical Piano Music for Baby Sleep&lt;/em&gt; by Baby Lullaby Academy), and one was not a piece of music, but rather an audiobook chapter read by Michael Morpurgo. These unknown composers are not omitted for the percentage calculations — &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/streaming-service-demographic-analysis.html#unknown-composers&quot;&gt;see the methodology section for more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theoretical underpinning of this whole exercise is “what classical music do new listeners find on streaming platforms”, and no listeners are newer than children. Pretty disappointing that this whole playlist has no women or people of colour at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, music for children has the same representation issues as music for any other audience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/9506870/childrens-music-album-grammy-nominees-withdraw-lack-diversity/&quot;&gt;Billboard recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that “three of this year’s five Grammy nominees for best children’s music album asked the Recording Academy to withdraw their nominations to signal their disappointment that all the nominees in the category are white and only one is female.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-up-spotify&quot;&gt;Next Up: Spotify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spotify classical playlists were longer than those on Apple Music, and had greater representation of composers who are women and composers who are Black, Indigenous, or people of colour. So I’ll split my Spotify deep dive into two or three posts so that I can talk about all the tracks in proper detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streaming is now the primary way that most people listen to music. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@RIAA/charting-a-path-to-musics-sustainable-success-12a5625bbc7d#8e10&quot;&gt;According to the Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/a&gt;, streaming now accounts for 79% of U.S. music industry revenues &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve read any feature piece about the past and future of the music industry, you’ve probably seen the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riaa.com/u-s-sales-database/&quot;&gt;RIAA’s graph of how revenue sources have changed over time&lt;/a&gt;. As someone who went to high school in the late 2000s, my favourite thing about this graph is looking at the “Era of Paying for Ringtones” between about 2005 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classical music has lagged behind in the overall trend towards streaming: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46861984&quot;&gt;a report covered by the BBC in 2019&lt;/a&gt; showed that in the UK, CD sales were still dominant (and growing) in the classical genre. Classical streaming was much smaller as a proportion of the UK market (about a quarter of sales compared to two thirds overall) but catching up quickly. In fact, year over year growth in classical streaming was reported to be 42% compared to 33% for streaming overall. A recent article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/2020/03/10/report-streaming-music-the-song-economy-classical-music/&quot;&gt;Ludwig van Toronto exploring the same figures in-depth&lt;/a&gt; speculated that “those figures are generally recognized to represent existing classical music lovers. Streaming is the way to get that new blood the classical music world is always looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So — continuing the train of thought &lt;a href=&quot;/music/2020/12/30/exploring-orchestral-music-race-gender-representation-composers.html&quot;&gt;from my last post&lt;/a&gt; — when someone searches for “classical” in their streaming service of choice, what do they find?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they’re listening to some of the most popular classical or orchestral playlists on Spotify or Apple Music, you won’t hear many pieces by composers of colour, or women composers. In some cases you won’t hear them at all. In many cases, your chances of hearing such composers is two to three times higher at a local US symphony than it is on the top classical playlists on these major streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-classical-playlist-analysis&quot;&gt;Summary: Classical Playlist Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this analysis, I examined top classical playlists — four from Apple Music, and four from Spotify — that you might find by searching “classical” or “orchestral” in each service and picking from the top results. I compared the number of composers that were women, Black, Indigenous, and people of colour in these playlists with similar numbers from the recent mainstage programs of 120 US orchestras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-orchestra-mainstage-seasons&quot;&gt;US Orchestra Mainstage Seasons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparator I’m using is from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;Institute for Composer Diversity&lt;/a&gt;. From their 2019/20 season analysis, this is the representation of composers by number of times their pieces were programmed by orchestras:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;tbody&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;120 US Orchestras&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;5.8%&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4.5%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple-music-summary&quot;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official classical playlists on Apple Music consistently had about half the number of women composers compared to the average US orchestra mainstage season, and only their new releases playlist, &lt;em&gt;The A-List: Classical&lt;/em&gt;, had any pieces by composers of colour (one track by Sofiane Pamart and another by Alexis Ffrench). Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Kids&lt;/em&gt; playlist in particular exclusively featured white men composers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spotify-summary&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s classical playlists were slightly better, but still lagged US orchestras in representation. Most of their playlists had — at best — about half the number of women composers or composers of colour compared to the average US orchestra mainstage season. The one exception was Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical New Releases&lt;/em&gt; playlist, which had nearly comparable representation of women composers, and slightly greater representation of composers of colour. &lt;em&gt;Classical New Releases&lt;/em&gt; also holds the distinction of having the only track written by an Indigenous composer (Yorta Yorta woman Deborah Cheetham).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full figures and composer details for Spotify playlists to come in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what&quot;&gt;So What?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these platforms have made repeated commitments to improve representation of women and people of colour on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After mass protests in response to racism and police brutality, in particular the police killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-06-01/spotify-stands-with-the-black-community-in-the-fight-against-racism-and-injustice/&quot;&gt;Spotify announced on Blackout Tuesday that it “Stands With the Black Community in the Fight Against Racism and Injustice”&lt;/a&gt;, and outlined a number of measures to amplify Black musicians and podcasts on its platform. Two weeks later, it pledged to donate USD $10 million to “organizations that are focused on the fight against racism, injustice, and inequity around the world”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277501/spotify-blackout-tuesday-george-floyd-racism-police-brutality-violence-protest&quot;&gt;Apple Music made some similar symbolic changes to its platform&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/31/apple-ceo-tim-cook-email-to-employees-about-george-floyd.html&quot;&gt;Apple pledged to make unspecified donations to racial justice organizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, many months later, pieces by Black composers remain scarce on classical playlists on both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to commitments to support movements for racial justice, these platforms have also tried to position themselves as being on the vanguard of sharing the wealth of music offered by global multicuturalism. In 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-09-28/discover-hits-from-around-the-world-with-spotifys-global-cultures-initiative/&quot;&gt;Spotify launched their Global Cultures Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, “which promotes and advances culturally diverse music, surfacing hits from different countries around the world”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, just over a year later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotifys-head-of-african-music-tunde-ogundipe-leaves-service-alongside-indian-music-expert-himanshu-suri/&quot;&gt;Spotify disbanded the original Global Cultures curatorial team&lt;/a&gt;. Although they pledged to continue the initiative with “a larger, region-specific editorial team of experts”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/spotify-global-cultures-initiative-892762/&quot;&gt;the change elicited negative reactions from many artists, as reported by Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Rolling Stone also noted that the disbanding coincided with an exodus of several high-profile curators who are people of colour, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/how-spotify-hopes-to-win-the-podcasting-wars.html&quot;&gt;a nearly-billion dollar shift towards podcasting&lt;/a&gt; — which has largely been to the benefit of creators and businesspeople who are white and established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underrepresentation of women has also been an issue on streaming platforms for many years. In 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/martina-mcbride-spotify-country-music-882401/&quot;&gt;country singer Martina McBride posted about her frustration with overwhelmingly male-dominated algorithmic recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/country-music-radio-has-ignored-female-artists-years-we-have-ncna1137571&quot;&gt;a genre that is well known for being hostile to female artists&lt;/a&gt;. Musicologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://songdata.ca/2019/10/01/reflecting-on-spotifys-recommender-system/&quot;&gt;Dr. Jada E. Watson also found similar results when testing the algorithmic song recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for country music fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebaffler.com/latest/discover-weakly-pelly&quot;&gt;writer Liz Pelly used Spotify’s absurd “Smirnoff Equalizer” marketing campaign to show that the platform had a distinct male bias&lt;/a&gt; that was “subtly shifting us back toward a more homogenous and overtly masculine pop music culture”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I listened almost exclusively to a sampling of the most popular entries: Today’s Top Hits, New Music Friday, Rock This, Rap Caviar, Hot Country, ¡Viva Latino!, and more. Every week, for one month, I downloaded a spreadsheet of the playlist data and analyzed the gender disparity. In the interest of not misgendering artists on the basis of their appearance or sound, I focused on confirming how artists self-identify on their Spotify “about” pages or other verified bios.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The result of this experiment: I found Spotify’s most popular and visible playlists to be staggeringly male-dominated. Not only this, I approached the project by listening from a brand new account in order to confirm that gender bias would be reproduced by way of algorithmic recommendations—that when a user listens to mostly male-dominated playlists, what is produced are yet more male-dominated playlists. Indeed, the sexist music industry status quo is upheld widely by Spotify, even as the platform exploits the woke optics of playlists like Feminist Friday and advertising schemes like the Smirnoff Equalizer to further benefit its brand recognition and bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, human–algorithmic curation that reinforces bias against cis women is even more inhospitable for trans and non-binary musicians. Despite looking through hundreds of songs, Liz Pelly reported that she “encountered no artists on Spotify’s top playlists who did not identify as a man or woman”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the platforms could argue that classical music is such a small niche that it’s just been overlooked by their efforts to feature diverse artists. Or that the lack of representation in their playlists reflects a lack of representation in a historically-white genre. But neither of these reactions would hold up to much scrutiny. Wouldn’t a genuine commitment to diversity be reflected in all curatorial decisions; in official playlists of all sizes? If the genre is to blame, why do most of the playlists have at best half the number of women composers or composers of colour compared to an average US orchestra season?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;annotation-wrapper&quot;&gt;Playlist diversity compared to orchestra mainstage programming is not a hard benchmark to exceed. Most orchestras are literally-eurocentric, small-c conservative institutions. And yet, the meager steps taken by US orchestras — at least a full year before the pandemic &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orchestras are known for having long planning timelines. For the 2019/20 season, conductors and soloists might have been booked two or three years ahead of their performances.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The latest a piece could have been confirmed would have been December 2018 (maybe January 2019 at a stretch), since marketing teams then need to prepare materials for a mid-winter subscription on-sale that usually launches at least half a year in advance of the first performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt; — to program more composers from the likes of Florence Price, Gabriela Lena Frank, Jennifer Higdon, and Anna Clyne have put them much further ahead than the current efforts of these two tech companies &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dates that tracks were added to a Spotify playlist are visible in the metadata, so we know when curatorial decisions were published:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All of the tracks in &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt; were added on October 2, 2020&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The tracks in &lt;em&gt;Classical New Releases&lt;/em&gt; were added between December 18, 2020 and January 1, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All of the tracks in &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt; were added on January 1, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orchestra 100: Spotify Picks&lt;/em&gt; by contrast, hasn’t been actively curated since 2017; most of the tracks were added in May of 2016&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Apple Music’s metadata has “Date Modified” and “Date Added” fields, but both appear to be blank when exporting data from official playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to see progress in orchestra programming continue and pick up speed. If streaming platforms lived up to their diversity commitments, perhaps a new generation of audience members who discover classical composers online would act as a catalyst, demanding orchestra programs that better represent the communities that ensembles work in. As it is, these platforms are cementing the status quo; investing in unseen curators and algorithms who spend their time tending to a musical monoculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-better-options&quot;&gt;Some Better Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people looking to find ways to listen to a more diverse range of classical music composers, there are some options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For US listeners, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/media&quot;&gt;Institute for Composer Diversity has a partnership with Pandora&lt;/a&gt; to curate channels that feature a diverse mix of composers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Canadian listeners, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/2-4278-tempo&quot;&gt;CBC’s &lt;em&gt;Tempo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a good choice. There are also a number of Canadian composers who are women or people of colour featured on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmccanada.org/product-category/recordings/centrediscs/&quot;&gt;Canadian Music Centre’s Centredisks Label&lt;/a&gt;. (Centredisks albums are also on the major streaming services, e.g. you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/4YJETJz7W99jMXRlEHPWJb?si=pLfDSybqRbiSB6chYt0x4g&quot;&gt;listen to Alexina Louie’s &lt;em&gt;Take the Dog Sled&lt;/em&gt; on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;. While I’m at it, I should shill a little bit and note that you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYvegcavM9k&quot;&gt;listen to her Triple Concerto&lt;/a&gt; on the TSO’s YouTube channel.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the major streaming services themselves, there are some playlists designed to specifically showcase women composers, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5hL1aT2vhMb&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Women of Classical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/women-in-classical-music/pl.03392dae73604942b02ab8e53c482ae0&quot;&gt;Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;Women in Classical Music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn’t find official playlists on either service specifically for classical composers of colour, but you can certainly find third party playlists, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/67avQ7fZ1zvEk1RDI9C3sd?si=ydgJJhfnQ1OCiRCjv3A7Pg&quot;&gt;this playlist on Spotify made by NAXOS for Black History Month&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll also give an honourable mention to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uoftfomara.org/&quot;&gt;University of Toronto Faculty of Music Anti-Racism Alliance&lt;/a&gt; who made this &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KsIccKNvDyftVlxWWPEdQ?si=7d886f70c97b420b&quot;&gt;Centring BIPOC Musicians Playlist&lt;/a&gt; (It has a much broader selection of genres than orchestral/classical, but I think it’s very good).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, although the numbers of women composers and composers who are Indigenous, Black, or people of colour on streaming services are low, I researched over 650 tracks for this project &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;It’s actually 666 tracks exactly, which feels very ominous. Maybe I should throw out the one track on Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Kids&lt;/em&gt; where Michael Morpurgo just reads a book on the basis of not being music so that I can say it’s 665…&lt;/span&gt;, so the list of people who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; represented is still fairly long and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those will be the next posts - doing a deep dive into the specific composers represented on the Apple Music and Spotify playlists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking about creative ways that people can explore orchestral music and find new pieces that they like, I’ve been thinking a lot about representation. There are many good pieces written by composers who don’t fit the stereotype of dead white men, and I want to make sure they are prominently featured in my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, this means exploring the work of living composers, since opportunities for women composers and composers of colour are marginally better now than in previous centuries. In other cases, it means exploring composers from history who are recently being “rediscovered”. Sometimes the rediscovery is literal, as in the case of Florence Price’s fourth symphony, written in 1945, where the manuscript was found in 2009 during a renovation of what used to be her summer home
&lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/05/the-rediscovery-of-florence-price&quot;&gt;New Yorker Magazine: “The Rediscovery of Florence Price”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
Other times, the rediscovery is more of a re-examination, such as appreciating Clara Schumann as a talented composer and performer in her own right, and not just a footnote to her husband’s legacy
&lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/arts/music/clara-schumann.html&quot;&gt;New York Times: “Clara Schumann, Music’s Unsung Renaissance Woman”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about race and gender representation is an interesting way to look at music, but it also leads us into other interesting trains of thought. Exploring new music naturally leads us to thinking about the curators—visible and invisible—that select music, promote it, and make it easy to find. It’s also an interesting way to think about the tension between honouring the past and pushing for the future; to what extent orchestras should spend their time acting as a living museum versus playing the work of artists on the vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I hope that highlighting diverse composers for people who want to get into orchestral music helps to cement change. Familiarity is essential to enjoyment and mass appeal, as noted in the 2019 book &lt;em&gt;Rockonomics&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[T]here is a tendency for music that is popular in our networks to become more appealing to us. And bandwagon effects are further reinforced by the well-established psychological tendency for people to grow to like a particular song the more they hear it.” &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Krueger, Alan B. &lt;em&gt;Rockonomics: A Backstage Tour of What the Music Industry Can Teach Us about Economics and Life&lt;/em&gt;. Broadway Business, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The author cites two research papers for the last quoted sentence, which I have listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;David J. Hargreaves, “The Effects of Repetition on Liking for Music,” &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Music Education&lt;/em&gt; 32, no. 1 (1984): 35–47 (No public PDF link, but you should be able to get a copy if your local library has access to JSTOR.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Robert B. Zajonc, “Attitudinal Effects of Mere Exposure,” &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; 9, no. 2, pt. 2 (1968): 1–27. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/9_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_1_%28Zajonc%29.pdf&quot;&gt;Link to PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the more that people discover, listen to, and enjoy the work of composers who are people of colour, women, or both, the more that these composers will be given their rightful stature in the “canon” of orchestral music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;research-on-composer-representation-in-orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;Research on composer representation in orchestra seasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to some of my own research, I have been looking at existing research that has been done on the representation of composers within orchestra seasons (primarily for orchestras in the United States). I’ve included a list at the &lt;a href=&quot;#appendix-analyses-of-orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;end of this post&lt;/a&gt; as an appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these analyses highlight the lack of women composers, composers of colour, or both, who are programmed in orchestra seasons. The good news is that some progress is being made — for example, among the biggest US orchestras, representation of women composers has more than tripled in the last five years (more on this later). However, there is still a long way to go — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;2019/20 season analysis of 120 US orchestras from the Institute for Composer Diversity&lt;/a&gt; found that only 8% of works performed were by women composers, and only 6% were by composers from underrepresented racial, ethnic, or cultural heritages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-just-who-also-how&quot;&gt;Not just &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;: also &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement the quantitative information from the various season analyses mentioned above, I want to introduce two other interesting ways to dig deeper into how composers are represented in orchestra programs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;duration-and-placement&quot;&gt;Duration and placement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common format for an orchestral concert looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A short feature piece, maybe about 10-15 minutes long&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A medium-length piece, usually a concerto &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;A concerto is a piece of music that showcases a soloist, e.g. a pianist or violinist.&lt;/span&gt; or a short symphony&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A long piece, usually a symphony or some other multi-movement work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this pretty clearly in the format of MasterWorks &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;The TSO’s MasterWorks series is what you might call the orchestra’s “core classical” program. The TSO also has pops concerts, school and youth concerts, film concerts, and other special events. Most of the season analyses I’ve linked to in the appendix only focus on core classical concerts for artistic and logistical reasons.&lt;/span&gt; concerts from the TSO’s last season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;A visual summary of the duration
&lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;It’s interesting to note that the median total length of pieces + intermission for these programs is about 100 minutes, which is very close to the average movie runtime in recent decades (For more on movies, see this interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/are-new-movies-longer-than-they-were-10hh20-50-year-ago-a35356b2ca5b&quot;&gt;analysis of movie runtimes done by Przemysław Jarząbek on the Toward Data Science blog&lt;/a&gt;.) In reality, I would guess the median concert runtime is probably about 110 minutes due to stage resets between pieces, introductions, etc.&lt;/span&gt;
and placement of pieces in TSO MasterWorks concerts planned for the 2019/20 season. Rows represent individual concert programs, with each piece colour-coded by type. The large uncoloured gaps represent intermissions. Concerts have been ordered by onset of intermission for visual clarity. &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;Source: Concert programs for 2019/20 Toronto Symphony Orchestra MasterWorks concerts. Due to COVID-19, not all of these concerts actually happened—about a third of them were cancelled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, pieces by living composers get put into the “short feature piece” slot. I’m don’t know for sure why this is, so I can only speculate. Maybe this is because writing or commissioning new music for orchestra involves a lot of expense and effort, so long pieces written by living composers are rarer. Another potential reason is the fact that orchestra concerts themselves are expensive to produce, so it’s risky to bet your biggest piece on something audiences don’t already know and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly more cynical take would be that, for some people, new music has a reputation of being hard to listen to, so keeping it short and early in the program makes concerts tolerable for audience members who don’t like abstract or atonal music that much. The Baltimore Symphony has a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/reconsidering-our-assumptions-about-new-music/&quot;&gt;blog post about the reputation that “new music” has with audiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it’s notable when works by a composer of colour, or a woman composer (or honestly, a living composer) takes the longest spot on the program. In fact, the Institute for Composer Diversity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/programming&quot;&gt;specifically makes a point of recommending&lt;/a&gt; that Orchestras “Include more substantial works by composers from underrepresented groups in the second or third positions on the program.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;representation-in-marketing-materials&quot;&gt;Representation in marketing materials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing focus is also an interesting way to think about programming, and is reflected in the title of a concert program, its description, and the images used to sell it. My guess is that in most orchestras, the names and descriptions for concert programs are primarily written by the marketing department, with some input from the artistic staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerts are most commonly named after the most well-known piece on the program, the featured soloist or conductor, or some combination of both. It’s very rare for a concert program title to be based on a living composer, unless it’s a Pops Concert (e.g. “Music of John Williams”). It’s notable when this occasionally happens, since it signifies an intentional artistic decision or that the living composer is popular enough that their name will sell tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy had some &lt;a href=&quot;https://wophil.org/2017-18-season-by-the-numbers/?doing_wp_cron=1609128744.0469379425048828125000&quot;&gt;good notes on this subject in their 2017/18 season analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that even though these works are being performed, they are not necessarily being recognized or promoted.  There were disturbingly few mentions of works by women in the online or print descriptions of each concert, even when the included work was commissioned.  For example, the Seattle Symphony has included Lili Boulanger’s &lt;em&gt;D’un matin de printemps&lt;/em&gt; for a program titled Rachmaninov Symphony No. 3, taking place in February.  The other works on the program include Elgar’s Violin Concerto and, of course, the Rachmaninov Symphony.  The description for the event, however, only mentions two of the three[.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed, Boulanger’s piece is the one out of the three not mentioned in the concert description—and this is only one out of four examples WPA included of women composers being ignored in marketing materials. (I would highly encourage you to go &lt;a href=&quot;https://wophil.org/2017-18-season-by-the-numbers/?doing_wp_cron=1609128744.0469379425048828125000&quot;&gt;read the whole post&lt;/a&gt; - it’s very good.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I want to explore to the various season analyses that are linked below. Before that (in the next post), I’m going to use some of my own research to take a look at representation in some of the biggest classical and orchestral playlists from Spotify and Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/all-stories&quot;&gt;Baltimore Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; had a series called “By the Numbers” analyzing the concert seasons of top US orchestras:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/the-2014-15-orchestra-season-by-the-numbers.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Baltimore 2014/15 (22 Orchestras)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore series stopped after three seasons, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://wophil.org/&quot;&gt;Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy&lt;/a&gt; started doing their own season analysis starting in 2016/17 with a smaller list of 21 orchestras &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;I think the intention was to continue using the 21 orchestras that Baltimore had initially looked at for 2014/15, though Baltimore later added Nashville, bringing their 2014/15 number up to 22.&lt;/span&gt; as a way to highlight the lack of women composers represented in orchestra programs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another organization, called DONNE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://donne-uk.org/orchestras-research/&quot;&gt;has been doing similar analysis for a more global set of 15 orchestras&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://donne-uk.org/2018-2019/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DONNE 2018/19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DONNE also has a research page with links to other studies on representation in music, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.presencecompositrices.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bilan-Novembre-2019-_OBSERVER.pdf&quot;&gt;one on (mostly-classical) French music festivals&lt;/a&gt;, which I have put on my reading list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/&quot;&gt;Institute for Composer Diversity&lt;/a&gt; was founded within the School of Music at the State University of New York at Fredonia. They published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;analysis of Orchestra Seasons for 2019/20&lt;/a&gt; that includes data from 120 orchestras. Their analysis looks at representation of composers from underrepresented racial, ethnic, or cultural heritages in addition to gender.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Music" /><summary type="html">Introduction</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Exploring Orchestral Music via a Favourite Instrument</title><link href="https://tallcoleman.me/music/2020/12/20/exploring-orchestral-music-favourite-instrument-horn.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exploring Orchestral Music via a Favourite Instrument" /><published>2020-12-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-12-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://tallcoleman.me/music/2020/12/20/exploring-orchestral-music-favourite-instrument-horn</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tallcoleman.me/music/2020/12/20/exploring-orchestral-music-favourite-instrument-horn.html">&lt;p&gt;I like Orchestral music quite a lot. I used to be in a youth orchestra, I work for an orchestra now—orchestral music plays a big role in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, lots of people find getting into orchestral music intimidating. Even I do, from time to time. So I thought I would write about some creative ways that people can explore orchestral music and find new pieces that they like. My hope is that this will be informative for people who are new to orchestral music, and interesting to people who already feel they know orchestral music pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to start with the way that I found a lot of pieces I like to listen to now: by looking at pieces that feature a favourite instrument. If you’ve played an instrument, and liked it, that’s often a good way to get into music. However, even just being a fan of a certain instrument is a great way to find some music that you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pieces-with-good-french-horn-parts&quot;&gt;Pieces with good French Horn parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played French Horn throughout high school and into University, and this helped introduce me to a number of great pieces of orchestral music. In some cases, I learned about pieces I liked by playing them (e.g. Tchaikovsy’s sixth symphony, Bizet’s &lt;em&gt;Carmen&lt;/em&gt;), but in other cases I learned about pieces through excerpts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excerpts are small sections from pieces that musicians have to play when they do orchestra auditions. (In most cases, they will be required to play a full piece or movement from a pieces as well). Excerpts are meant to demonstrate their ability to play a broad range of music and their skill with some of the most challenging or high-stakes parts they might encounter playing with the orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, if you’re a fan of a certain instrument, looking through the pieces on an audition list is a great way to find pieces that feature some pretty amazing parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to take some top picks for French Horn, but you could do this for any instrument you’re a fan of. Just search for “favourite instrument” + “excerpts” or “favourite instrument” + “audition list” and you’ll find lots to get you started. Maybe I’ll do a couple other instruments in later posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put links to albums on Spotify and also links to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornsociety.org/hornexcerpts-org&quot;&gt;International Horn Society’s excerpts pages&lt;/a&gt; so that you can easily find the parts I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tchaikovsky-symphony-no-5-second-movement&quot;&gt;Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 5, Second Movement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most beautiful French Horn solos in the orchestral repertoire. Although it doesn’t sound like it, it’s absolute murder to play since holding long, high notes without a break is a real workout for the lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horn player in this recording is presumably Dale Clevenger, who retired in 2013 after nearly five decades as Chicago’s principal horn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonus-holst-the-planets-second-movement-venus-the-bringer-of-peace&quot;&gt;Bonus: Holst &lt;em&gt;The Planets&lt;/em&gt;, Second Movement “Venus, the Bringer of Peace”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another famous and incredibly serene French Horn solo. Also incredibly difficult for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSO’s principal horn is Neil Deland. Maybe it’s home team bias, but I’m always blown away by the quality of his sound and how it just totally fills the hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mahler-symphony-no-5-first-and-third-movements&quot;&gt;Mahler Symphony No. 5, First and Third Movements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/6Mlx6uECLVK8v4q0zPyqdL&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;🔗 Spotify: Philadelphia Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like things to get loud, Mahler is a pretty safe bet. (One of his symphonies famously features a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSh5I_rMr9c&quot;&gt;comically large hammer&lt;/a&gt; as an instrument.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good horn parts are everywhere in this one, including in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornsociety.org/mahler/mahler5#excerpt-1&quot;&gt;The opening fanfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornsociety.org/mahler/mahler5#excerpt-2&quot;&gt;A scale, but dramatic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornsociety.org/mahler/mahler5#excerpt-3&quot;&gt;The happy part in-between all the turmoil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornsociety.org/mahler/mahler5#excerpt-4&quot;&gt;The part where four horn players have to play the same loud note in tune (just after 1:00 in the linked clips)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;annotation-link&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;Most people consider French Horn to be a hard instrument to consistently play in tune because of how much the pitch can be affected by what you do with your lips and the hand that sits in the bell. These four notes are particularly difficult because they have to be played with the bell end of the horn held up in the air, which makes playing in tune even harder (no hand control and harder to keep the mouthpiece stable on your lips). The video with Sarah Willis linked below gives a good demonstration of how the hand can sometimes be used to help manage pitch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia’s principal horn is Jennifer Montone - she’s played on a wide range of recordings that includes her work as a soloist, in orchestras, and in chamber groups.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jenmontone.com/discography&quot;&gt;Jennifer Montone’s Discography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like fanfares and big soaring passages, you’ll probably like Strauss’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornsociety.org/strauss/strauss-te&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Till Eulenspiegel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornsociety.org/strauss/strauss-eh&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ein Heldenleben&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philharmonia’s principal horn is Nigel Black. I thought it might also be interesting to link this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZoZLWaMYaQ&quot;&gt;video of Sarah Willis from the Berlin Philharmonic giving a demonstration of &lt;em&gt;Till Eulenspiegel&lt;/em&gt; and also a common Beethoven excerpt&lt;/a&gt;. I think it’s a good demonstration that being a good horn player often isn’t about playing things that are super complicated and fiddly, but rather playing things that often sound simple while achieving the best sound possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ravel-pavane-for-a-dead-princess&quot;&gt;Ravel: &lt;em&gt;Pavane for a Dead Princess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An all time classic. Incredibly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recording was conducted by the TSO’s new Music Director, Gustavo Gimeno. The horn player I would guess is OPL’s principal, Miklós Nagy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like the French, you should check out this other Cleveland Orchestra recording, which is of Berlioz’s &lt;em&gt;Symphonie fantastique&lt;/em&gt;. The principal horn on the recording is Shelly Showers, who now is part of the Philadelphia Orchestra (they’ve got some incredible horn section bench strength over there…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today - the next post will be looking at ways to explore living and diverse composers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Music" /><summary type="html">I like Orchestral music quite a lot.

However, the TSO needed some extra help writing web content recently, and I was incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to write about Carl Orff’s &lt;em&gt;Carmina Burana&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, orchestral music seems very “proper” most of the time—art that is produced for aesthetic enjoyment and nothing else. However, orchestral music is like any other art form, and contains many examples of the political, the extreme, and the provocative. Some well-known examples would include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leck_mich_im_Arsch&quot;&gt;Mozart’s &lt;em&gt;Leck mich im Arsch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (I am also quite fond of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vuq9Ls2OVs&quot;&gt;Mozart’s “motivational” notes in the original score for his first Horn Concerto&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;John Adams’ various compositions, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Atomic&quot;&gt;an opera about the Manhattan Project&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Klinghoffer&quot;&gt;another opera based on the 1985 Palestinian Liberation Front hijacking of a passenger liner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen&quot;&gt;Wagner’s entire Ring Cycle, which heavily features an incestuous romance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a musical experience, &lt;em&gt;Carmina Burana&lt;/em&gt; is enjoyable and varied, but the fun is heightened by the fact that it is based on a historical collection of poems that are crude, satirical, and highly sexual. As a result, the source text is quite a fun read, and I enjoyed finding excerpts to feature in my blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy reading them too, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tso.ca/coming-soon-carl-orff-carmina-burana&quot;&gt;my post about &lt;em&gt;Carmina Burana&lt;/em&gt; on the TSO website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="TSO" /><summary type="html">As a grant writer, I don’t get to write for the public very often.
