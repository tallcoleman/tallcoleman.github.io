It’s such a simple and effective way of organizing information and getting helpful summary info with per-group subtotals. However, now that Airtable is blocked by the firewall at work, I’ve been having to make do with pivot tables or manually grouping data into sections in Excel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/airtable-grouped-records.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of data on Canadian cities in Airtable with rows grouped by province. There is a heading for each section along with summary functions for certain columns.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;An example of grouped records in Airtable&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sadly, Excel is way behind when it comes to simple and useful grouping of data &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Although pivot tables are powerful, they have a terrible UI for custom styles, and can be pretty fiddly. Similarly, Excel’s “group data” features allow you to expand and collapse rows, but row groups don’t dynamically update as data changes, and require a lot of manual upkeep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One Excel feature I do love (well, love-hate) is &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/about-power-query-in-excel-7104fbee-9e62-4cb9-a02e-5bfb1a6c536a&quot;&gt;Power Query&lt;/a&gt;. It has some quirks, but it offers a lot of power when combined with named table ranges &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It’s a great way to take your existing data and merge tables together or pull a subset of data onto another sheet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I decided to try making grouped records using a custom Power Query formula &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and it turned out pretty well! If you want to try it yourself, I’ve included the code and instructions below. Here’s a sneak peek at the final result:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-print-output-multigroup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Print preview of an Excel table with data on Canadian cities grouped by province and municipal status. The group headers are in clear shades of blue with summary totals at the bottom of each section.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-info&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel-info panel-heading&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the Script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tallcoleman/power-query-collection/tree/main/GroupByCategory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get the code for the query formula on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To use this query formula, you’ll need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-structured-references-with-excel-tables-f5ed2452-2337-4f71-bed3-c8ae6d2b276e&quot;&gt;named table&lt;/a&gt; with data that includes a column for your grouping category. For our example, we’ll use Wikipedia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_municipalities_in_Canada_by_population&quot;&gt;list of the largest municipalities in Canada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-city-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Excel table with data on Canadian cities.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make a grouped list of our data, first we’ll load the data into Power Query using Data &amp;gt; From Table/Range.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-data-from-table-range.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Excel with a red arrow pointing to the &amp;quot;From Table/Range&amp;quot; menu button.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the query editor, before we start transforming our data, we’ll first have to set up the custom function. On the left, right-click and then select New Query &amp;gt; Other Sources &amp;gt; Blank Query.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-new-query-blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Power Query editor showing the menu tree for creating a new blank query.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rename your new blank query GroupByCategory &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, open the Advanced Editor, remove the placeholder text and paste in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tallcoleman/power-query-collection/blob/main/GroupByCategory/GroupByCategory.pq&quot;&gt;script from Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-advanced-editor-button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Power Query editor with a red arrow pointing to the &amp;quot;Advanced Editor&amp;quot; button.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pasted code should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-script-paste.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of function code pasted into the Power Query advanced editor.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the custom function set up, we can now go back and use it for the city data. In the city data query, open up the advanced editor and add in a new row as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Add a comma to the end of the last row before &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Just after that row (but still before the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword), add in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&quot;Grouped Rows&quot; = GroupByCategory(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;, {&quot;Province&quot;})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Change the last line to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&quot;Grouped Rows&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-script-groupby-province.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Power Query advanced editor with the described edits to the default code for loading in data from a table.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, you can select “Close &amp;amp; Load” and Excel will insert a new tab with your output table. It still needs some formatting work, but you can see it’s now grouped our data by province.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-raw-output-groupby-province.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of an unformatted query data table loaded into Excel. The table is in the default green colour with column widths auto-set by contents.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;wait-what-did-i-just-do&quot;&gt;Wait, What Did I Just Do??&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t used the advanced editor before, this is what’s happening — the code for Power Query transform operations is written in a format like this, with all lines in each section except for the last one separated by commas:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pq&quot;&gt;let Source = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;expression that loads in your data&amp;gt;&amp;gt;, #&quot;Step A&quot;, // applies a transformation to Source #&quot;Step B&quot; // applies a transformation to #&quot;Step A&quot; in #&quot;Step B&quot; // step you want the output from &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you use the Power Query menu to do things like remove or reorder columns, or change data types, the program generates this code behind the scenes. Occasionally, when you need to do something more complex, you have to edit the code directly, like we did here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our case, we added a step that calls our custom function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GroupByCategory&lt;/code&gt;, which has two required arguments:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The table you want it to process (in our case, the output from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&quot;Changed Type&quot;&lt;/code&gt; step).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A list of the names of the columns that should be used to group the data. In our case, there was only one item in our list, but you’ll see an example at the end of grouping by more than one column.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our function then spits out a table with the data grouped, heading rows added, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the code behind Power Query, you can read through the documentation for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/&quot;&gt;Power Query M formula language&lt;/a&gt;, though be warned that it may be a bit challenging in places if you’re not familiar with computer programming jargon. If you search for “M Query Beginner” you’ll probably find some blogs and videos that have clearer and more example-based explanations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;formatting-your-table&quot;&gt;Formatting Your Table&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make our table look a little more presentable, let’s format it a little bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, let’s make sure we can manually control the column widths by changing the table properties. First, select any cell of the table, then select the “Properties” button in the “Table Design” section of the ribbon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-table-properties.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Excel with a red arrow pointing to the table &amp;quot;Properties&amp;quot; menu.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uncheck “Adjust column width” and select OK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-table-properties-menu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the &amp;quot;External Data Properties&amp;quot; settings window. The window is small and has several checkboxes and radio buttons.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will stop the table from auto-fitting the column widths when we refresh our data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also want to hide the StyleIndex column, which can be done by just hiding the column or by excluding it from the print area. To change the print area, select the columns you want to be printed, and then select Page Layout &amp;gt; Print Area &amp;gt; Set Print Area:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-set-print-area.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Excel showing the &amp;quot;Print Area&amp;quot; menu button.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the table itself, we can do some pretty simple formatting:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Choose a different table colour scheme from the Table Design menu in the ribbon&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Resize the H_Province column to e.g. 3 units and hide the heading title by changing the text colour of B1 to match the background&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apply some number formatting where needed (e.g. changing the Growth Rate column to percentages)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end, our table now looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-basic-format-groupby-province.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of formatted data table. The colour scheme is now black, white, and grey, column widths are custom-set, and group heading have been bolded.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;inline-layout&quot;&gt;Inline Layout&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;By default, the function will output a table in “Outline” style with a new column added on the left for each grouping level. This gives some visual indentation and allows you to easily format the headings by formatting just the heading column.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, you can also choose an “Inline” style where the headings are put in the first data column instead. To do this, we’re just going to add an option to our function call in the script using the optional third argument of the function, which lets us configure how the function works &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Now our function line will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&quot;Grouped Rows&quot; = GroupByCategory(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;, {&quot;Province&quot;}, [HeadingStyle = &quot;Inline&quot;])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-script-headingstyle-inline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Power Query advanced editor with the changed function arguments.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get our bolded heading, we’re going to have to use some conditional formatting. With our table data selected, select Home &amp;gt; Conditional Formatting &amp;gt; Manage Rules &amp;gt; New Rule and set up a formula rule with the function set to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;=$A2=&quot;Heading1&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (where $A2 is the first cell in the selected range). In this case, I’ve also set the text format for this rule to “bold”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-conditional-format-inline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the conditional formatting menu window. The top section has &amp;quot;Use a formula...&amp;quot; selected, the middle section contains a formula, and the bottom section has a formatting preview.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our result should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-output-inline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a formatted data table. The inline headings are bolded and the StyleIndex column is clearly outside of the print area as demarked by a thick blue border.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that for the Inline style, the group headings are in the first column (“Rank (2021)”) instead of in their own column to the left of the data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefit of conditional formatting is that it should continue to work as intended, even as your table grows or shrinks. With everything set up, when you need to use the table, all you’ll need to do is refresh the data (Right-click table and select “Refresh” or Data &amp;gt; Refresh All in the ribbon).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-summary-functions&quot;&gt;Adding Summary Functions&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In many cases, it’s also helpful to have automatic subtotals for certain columns show for each group. Let’s set that up now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go back into the query editor (Data &amp;gt; Queries &amp;amp; Connections &amp;gt; Right-Click and select “Edit”), open up the Advanced Editor again and add in the following line and function option:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pq&quot;&gt;SummaryFunctions = [ #&quot;Rank (2021)&quot; = List.Average, #&quot;Population (2021)&quot; = List.Sum meta [Name = &quot;Total&quot;], #&quot;Population (2016)&quot; = List.Sum meta [Name = &quot;Total&quot;], #&quot;Growth rate (2016-2021)&quot; = List.Average, #&quot;Land area (km2, 2021)&quot; = List.Sum meta [Name = &quot;Total&quot;] ], #&quot;Grouped Rows&quot; = GroupByCategory (#&quot;Changed Type&quot;, {&quot;Province&quot;}, [SummaryFunctions = SummaryFunctions]) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-script-summary-functions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Power Query advanced editor with the summary function code added in.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we’ve done here is define a &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/m-spec-values#record&quot;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; of summary functions to apply to specific columns, and provided that Record as an option for our function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By default, the function will also add in a row at the top with labels for the summary functions so that it’s clear which column has averages vs totals, etc. For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/list-functions&quot;&gt;built in List functions&lt;/a&gt; the name comes from the function itself, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List.Sum&lt;/code&gt; would be labeled “Sum”. However, you can provide your own labels by adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/metadata&quot;&gt;metadata field&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; like you can see in the example above, where we want our Sum functions to be labeled “Total” instead. The metadata label can also be used if you want to use your own custom functions for summarizing a column.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the output will look like (with some additional steps we’ll get into just below) — you can see we have per-group averages for the Rank column and per-group subtotals for the Population column.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-output-multigroup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a formatted data table. The group headings are in shades of blue, with summary functions below each group.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;grouping-by-multiple-columns&quot;&gt;Grouping by Multiple Columns&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might have also noticed in the example above that we have multiple groups, with the data grouped by Province, and then within each Province by Municipal Status.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To set this up, we just have to make a small change to our function line in the code so that we list both our grouping columns in the desired order:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pq&quot;&gt;#&quot;Grouped Rows&quot; = GroupByCategory (#&quot;Changed Type&quot;, {&quot;Province&quot;, &quot;Municipal status&quot;}, [SummaryFunctions = SummaryFunctions] ) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will now give us heading and summary rows for each grouping column, so let’s set up some more advanced conditional formatting to make the data structure clearer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-conditional-format-multigroup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the conditional formatting rules manager window showing three formula-based rules to set the blue headings for each group level and to apply a white background to blank rows.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(In this case, I’ve selected entire columns instead of just the table data, so the first cell in my range is $A1).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, it’s not obvious from the formatting options in the screenshot above, but the blank rows have a white background applied to override the alternating colours from the table style.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should now be everything we need to get our formatted, multi-grouped table:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-output-multigroup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat of the screenshot of a formatted data table. The group headings are in shades of blue, with summary functions below each group.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;some-printing-tips&quot;&gt;Some Printing Tips&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to hiding the StyleIndex column or excluding it from the print area, there are two small details you may want to set up if you want to print your table or save it to PDF:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you can have the heading row and summary function labels repeat on each page by going to Page Layout &amp;gt; Page Setup &amp;gt; Sheet and selecting these rows using the “Rows to repeat at top” control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-page-setup-menu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Page Setup menu in Excel. The &amp;quot;Rows to Repeat&amp;quot; formula box reads &amp;quot;$1:$2&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, in the Page Layout section of the ribbon, you may also want to change the page orientation to Landscape and set the Width to 1 Page if you have a lot of columns and want them all on the same page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, after you’ve refreshed your table data, you may want to adjust where the page breaks are by selecting the page break preview in the view options on the bottom-right hand corner of the application window (next to the zoom control). Once you’re in Page Break Preview, you can drag the break lines up as needed. If you ever need to reset the breaks and set them again from scratch, go to Page Layout &amp;gt; Breaks &amp;gt; Reset All Page Breaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With these options applied, you’ll have a print output that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/pqgroup-print-output-multigroup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat of the print preview of an Excel table with data on Canadian cities grouped by province and municipal status. The group headers are in clear shades of blue with summary totals at the bottom of each section.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This process may feel like a lot of steps, especially if you’ve never used many of these Excel features before. However, compared to setting up a grouped report in Microsoft Access or the Power BI Report Builder, using this custom function will be a lot easier for many people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For simpler cases, Pivot Tables might be a more straightforward solution, though I’ve often found them incredibly frustrating to format.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you really want to have some fun, you can also set up another table to specify your grouping columns and make your sheet into more of an interactive report generator. I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are still some unavoidable drawbacks to using Excel instead of Airtable. For example, you can’t edit your data directly in the grouped output table, and Excel for Mac doesn’t quite have the same number of Power Query features as the Windows version (&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/shape-data-with-power-query-editor-in-excel-for-mac&quot;&gt;though it’s quickly catching up&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, when Excel is the tool you need to use, I think this is a useful tool to have. I hope you find it useful too!

And when November’s cold winds came… I put on studded tyres and kept going. Overall, it’s been a surprisingly good experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2023-03-13 trail by Thomson Memorial with light snow.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of Thomson Memorial park trail with a bike in the foreground and visible footsteps and tyre marks in the light snow.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Light snow on the trail leading into Thomson Memorial park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the previous five years, I had worked downtown and biked to work using bike share, and I would continue biking more or less all year round. However, biking in Scarborough, I had two specific fears:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, that there would be no (or very unreliable) snow removal on the bike trails I rely on to get to work, forcing me to take pretty dangerous high-traffic suburban roads if I wanted to keep biking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, that without the flexibility of bike share, I would end up in a sticky situation if the evening weather was much worse than in the morning, or having to abandon my bike at the hospital and take transit home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;facing-the-fears&quot;&gt;Facing the Fears&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason I was so worried about inadequate snow clearing is that the information available was either confusing or indicated that there was no snow clearing on my route. For example, here is what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20221024014547/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-network-map/cycling-routes-snow-removal/&quot;&gt;City’s info page on winter bike route snow clearing looked like&lt;/a&gt; on October 24, 2022. Cross referencing with another webpage that has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-network-map/&quot;&gt;Toronto Cycling Map&lt;/a&gt; it doesn’t indicate anything about the “Major Multi-Use Trail” parts of my route and (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20221024014547/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-network-map/cycling-routes-snow-removal/&quot;&gt;link to yet another page&lt;/a&gt;) indicates that only the lowest level of clearing would apply to the neighbourhood roads that include “On-Street Shared Cycling Connections” (i.e. Sharrows).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wait! One of the trails goes through a park, so maybe it’s part of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20221102110558/https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/maps/index.html#PARKPATH&quot;&gt;list of Winter Maintained Paths/Roads throughout the city’s parks&lt;/a&gt;, which — you guessed it — can be found on yet another webpage. Except all it tells you is the park name and that the park features [a] “Winter Maintained Pathway”. Does that include my trail, or is the trail outside of the park boundary? Who knows!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If only there were sign… maybe like this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Google Street View - Rte 26 No Winter Maintenance Sign.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Google Street View showing a trail sign that reads &amp;quot;No Winter Maintenance&amp;quot;. There is a fence in the background.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Google Street View - no winter maintenance sign RT trail.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Google Street View showing a series of signs, one of which reads &amp;quot;No Winter Maintenance&amp;quot;. There is a large bush in the background.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or perhaps some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-winter-recreation-plans-1.5814471&quot;&gt;media coverage about how the main trails on the Meadoway aren’t cleared in winter&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, it didn’t paint a promising picture — and yet, I held out hope that maybe things had changed for winter 2022/23. After the first snow fall of the year, I woke up half an hour earlier so that I could &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt; my bike route and see for myself. Despite the confusing webpages, the off-putting “No Winter Maintenance” signs, and the negative media coverage, it was more or less all cleared and salted. Success!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20221206194014/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-network-map/cycling-routes-snow-removal/&quot;&gt;current City web page on winter bike route snow clearing&lt;/a&gt;, things are more encouraging, but still slightly confusing. “The City clears 776 km of bikeways and major trails across the city of ice and snow each winter.”. Great… how much of the bike system is that? 80%? 100%? Does it include the trail I take to get to work? At least it indicates that “Winter maintenance of cycle tracks … and multi-use paths is activated when 2 cm of snow accumulates”, which appears to be an improvement on the service standard communicated in October. So, kudos to the City for that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s some free communications advice: on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-network-map/&quot;&gt;Cycling Network Map&lt;/a&gt; page, maybe say something like “X% of the City’s cycling infrastructure is cleared of snow and ice in winter”, and then on the interactive map, maybe add a description that indicates whether each lane/trail/etc. is cleared in the winter, and at what level of snowfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-and-bad-of-snow-clearing&quot;&gt;The Good and Bad of Snow Clearing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, after a full winter of biking, how has the snow clearing been? I’ll start with the good: even after some pretty heavy snowfalls, there was sufficient clearing and salting that I could reliably get to and from work in a safe and timely way. There were only one or two days early in the season when I had to deflate my tyres slightly for traction &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and take things really slow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The confidence I now feel that I can rely on the trail network as long as I leave myself extra time on the rare mornings after very heavy snowfall is a major credit to the City of Toronto. Most of the time I wonder if I really needed the studded tires after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2022-12-21 trail by RT cleared.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Early-morning photo of the trail near the Scarborough RT line. The black pavement is dry, clear, and visible. Power lines run overhead on both sides.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;A cleared trail near Kennedy station by the Scarborough RT line. This is what the trail condition is like the majority of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are still some challenges, which occasionally add some frustration to the winter commute, and might still put some people off the prospect of winter biking in this area of Scarborough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most significant one is that many of the trails are not that well-lit at night. This makes it harder to spot the occasional ice patch or low-hanging tree branch &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Plus, it can be a little spooky at times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2023-01-17 RT bridge at night.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Evening photo of the pedestrian bridge over the rail line and the narrow path leading up to it on the west side, flanked on either side by chain-link fences. There is only one light in the foreground, giving off an orange glow in the misty air. Most of the scene is dark, except for some lights visible far off in the distance.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;This wouldn’t look out of place in an apocalyptic horror movie, probably. Not very comforting when you’re heading home at 5:30pm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I’m a 6’8” man, so my list of safety concerns mostly ends at “low tree branches”. But many people have a longer list of fears that would come with being on a sparsely-used trail in pitch darkness, so more lighting (and some emergency call posts in the most isolated sections of the trail) would be welcome additions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bridge over the RT line can also have some snow clearing issues, which is a challenge given that the alternative options for crossing the rail line are both more than a kilometre away and are both six-lane roads without protected bike infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2023-03-13 lots of snow on RT bridge.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Daytime photo of the pedestrian bridge over the RT line and the narrow path leading up to it on the west side. The path is covered in snow that is at least 15-30cm deep. A blue line 3 train is visible in the background, passing under the bridge.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;This was probably the worst day. It was hard going dragging the bike through this, and I really feel for all the parents with strollers that would usually walk with their kids to the school on the other side of the tracks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did bring the issues with the bridge to the attention of the local City Councillor’s office, so maybe they’ll figure out how to fix these problems. It almost seems like part of the problem is that the crew responsible for the bridge doesn’t work on weekends — if there’s a big snowfall over Saturday or Sunday, the bridge is often still clogged up on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2023-03-13 RT Bridge Cleared.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Daytime photo of the east side of the bridge over the rail line, which has straight ramps stacked back and forth down to ground level. The pavement is clear and visibly salted. In the background are some large evergreen trees and a power line.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Most of the bridge is usually in good condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve also run into the occasional small issue that gets fixed later, like having to push the bike over a windrow at the trail entrance (pretty bad after one snowfall, but perfectly cleared away after another).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Windrow at trail head.png&quot; alt=&quot;Collage of two photos. The first, dated January 30, 2023 shows a trail entrance from Marcos Blvd with a windrow blocking the ramp onto the trail from the road. the second, dated March 6, 2023 shows the same area, but with the connection completely cleared of snow.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or this case, where the trail plow lost its bearings slightly and cleared off a muddy section of grass instead (cleared properly when I went in the next week).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Off-trail snow clearing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Collage of two photos. The first, dated March 6, 2023, shows a trail next to a parking lot with snow still covering the trail and a cleared strip of muddy grass right next to it. The second, dated March 13, 2023, shows the same trail, but cleared of snow. A light-brown residential building around ten storeys high is visible in the background of both photos.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe my favourite is this big pile of snow, which doesn’t fully block the trail entrance, but definitely makes its presence felt. Almost like you should be politely saying “Sorry, just gotta scooch by ya!” every time you pass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2023-03-06 big pile of snow on trail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of a trail entrance from Lawrence Ave E, with a pile of dirty snow about 1.5 metres tall and 4 metres wide. The passable gap between the pile of snow and a bus shelter is about half a metre wide. Power lines and houses are visible in the background.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for my other fear of getting into a bad situation or having to leave my bike at the hospital, it hasn’t happened yet. Having the option to work from home most of the time the weather is forecast to be really bad definitely helps with this. Plus, I do have the studded tyres on both wheels as well as a decent toolkit in my cargo basket, so I don’t worry so much on more challenging days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;essential-winter-gear&quot;&gt;Essential Winter Gear&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a common frustration among cyclists that many people think it’s “too cold” to cycle in winter. As long as you cover your extremities properly, winter cycling isn’t an uncomfortably cold experience. In fact, there are many days when I don’t wear my parka or take it off mid-ride. Often I’m unzipping my sweater as well so that I don’t get sweaty. Turns out, light exercise keeps you warm, especially in the core and legs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The middle of summer is actually a bigger logistical barrier to cycling; at least in winter you can always remove layers if you get too warm. In June–August, you often have to bring a change of clothes! Despite trying several different methods, I’ve yet to find a reliable way to pack a dress shirt into a backpack without wrinkling it &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune on winter bike gear either — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4oo_UE8lPY&quot;&gt;this Shifter video&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of showing you how you can get through winter with stuff that’s cheap or that you already own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s my list of gear tips:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not sure I’ve ever seen this on a “winter cycling gear” list, but those pocket packages of tissues are a must-have. You’re going to be huffing a great volume of cold air, you’ll need them, trust me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marks.com/en/windriver-unisex-behind-the-head-band-ear-muffs-325032.html&quot;&gt;Ear muffs that wrap around the back of your head&lt;/a&gt; work great with a helmet, and will get you through most winter days. If it gets really cold you might want a thin and light hat to put under your helmet, but even then you don’t need something super warm, just enough to block the wind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marks.com/en/wel-max-unisex-thermal-t-max-heat-neck-tube-grey-351912.html&quot;&gt;fleece or wool neck tube&lt;/a&gt; is also a great thing to have. It stays on by itself, and you can pull it up over part of your face on really cold days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to have a combo of gloves and mitts — ideally the gloves should be durable and should allow you enough dexterity to work your bike lock. When it gets really cold, you can add the mitts on top of the gloves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure you buy long winter socks, and don’t cheap out on them too much. You won’t regret getting the good ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your jacket doesn’t need to be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; warm, especially if you wear a good sweater underneath. I suspect that a big down parka would actually be too much (I have a synthetic fill parka that’s about 10 years old). It is helpful to have somewhere you can easily stash layers if you need to remove them mid-ride, like a basket. If I take off my jacket, I usually fold it and quickly bungee it next to my backpack on the rear rack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wear a high-vis jacket when it’s dark in the winter, just so I’m not taking any chances. Most suburban drivers aren’t habitually watching for bikes on a winter night or early morning, sadly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You definitely want front and back fenders on your bike (plus a skirt guard if you can get one), and a chain case doesn’t hurt either. These are all pretty standard features on Dutch-style bikes (I bought mine from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.godutch.ca/&quot;&gt;Go Dutch on Eglinton&lt;/a&gt;). I also put studded tyres on both wheels, though lots of cyclists say you can get away with just having one studded tyre on the front.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;ok-but-is-it-fun&quot;&gt;OK, But is it &lt;em&gt;Fun&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2022-12-21 view from RT bridge 001.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Early morning photo looking out onto the rail line from a bridge. The foreground is completely covered by a chain link fence, through which there are visible rail tracks, trees, and a tall apartment building in the distance. The sky on the horizon is amber-coloured, fading up to grey-blue.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Sunrise from the bridge over the RT tracks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would say so! For one, the winter can be cold and kind of depressing, so getting active on the way to work definitely helps to keep the mood up during the grey and dark weeks. If you like dogs, there are still lots to say hi to along the way to work, especially in Scarborough where so much of the bike network relies on the recreational trail system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And occasionally you’ll see ice-jeweled trees after frozen rain or a winter sunrise on the way to the office. Those are special moments, and much nicer than staring at slush on the 401.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/2023-02-17 tree frozen rain 001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Morning photo of the sun rising over an ice-covered tree in Thomson Memorial park.

However, you could use this script for any drop-in program schedule, whether it’s for arts programs, fitness, general interest programs, skating, sports, or swimming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-i-dont-use-google-calendar&quot;&gt;What if I don’t use Google Calendar?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t normally use Google Calendar, you can still use a Google account to set things up and then share the Google calendar with your regular account (e.g. with Outlook). The easiest method (if it works) is to find the “Share with specific people” section of your Google calendar settings and then add the email for your main calendar account. You should receive an email to your main account that gives you instructions or options for adding the calendar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t work (e.g. if you’re using a work account that doesn’t let you add an external calendar the normal way), you can add the Google Calendar to your main calendar by going to the “Integration” section of your Google calendar settings and copy the “Secret address in iCal format”. You can use this private iCal address to add the calendar to your main app or account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, in Outlook on desktop, you would go to “Add Calendar”, select “From Internet…” and then paste in your secret iCal feed address. There’s a similar option for Outlook on the web as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Outlook Windows 365 - Add Calendar from Internet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots showing the Add Calendar and New Internet Calendar Subscription menus in Outlook desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;could-i-do-other-web-scraping-tasks-with-google-apps-script&quot;&gt;Could I do other web scraping tasks with Google Apps Script?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Possibly, but it would be pretty difficult for more complex pages that are hard to parse or that need to be loaded interactively (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&quot;&gt;single-page applications&lt;/a&gt;). In this case for the City of Toronto website, the relevant info is relatively easy to pull from the page source using regular expressions. Another case where I’ve been able to use Google Apps Script is where the website was just loading a JSON file from a static URL — in that case, I just pulled the JSON data directly into the script.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your use case is simple like this, there are several pros to using Google Apps Script: it’s free, easy to configure, comes with good documentation, integrates well with Google services, and you only have to know Javascript and some basic web development skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you need to grab something more complicated, you’ll probably have to either pay for a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://visualping.io/&quot;&gt;visualping.io&lt;/a&gt; or dig into some more advanced tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selenium.dev/&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; (for headless browsing), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/&quot;&gt;Beautiful Soup&lt;/a&gt; (for better HTML parsing), and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrapy.org/&quot;&gt;Scrapy&lt;/a&gt; (for building web crawlers).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Programming"/><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">Orchestra Diversity Leaders: Chicago Sinfonietta and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra</title><link href="https://tallcoleman.me/music/2023/01/28/orchestra-diversity-leaders-chicago-sinfonietta-cincinnati.md.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Orchestra Diversity Leaders: Chicago Sinfonietta and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra"/><published>2023-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://tallcoleman.me/music/2023/01/28/orchestra-diversity-leaders-chicago-sinfonietta-cincinnati.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tallcoleman.me/music/2023/01/28/orchestra-diversity-leaders-chicago-sinfonietta-cincinnati.md.html">&lt;!-- script for graphs --&gt; &lt;script&gt;function alertsize(pixels, iframeID){pixels+=5;document.getElementById(iframeID).style.height=pixels+&quot;px&quot;;}&lt;/script&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2020/12/30/exploring-orchestral-music-race-gender-representation-composers.html#appendix-analyses-of-orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;short round-up of different studies&lt;/a&gt; analyzing orchestra seasons and their repertoire. In that post, I talked about two additional factors to consider beyond the headline numbers for representation of women and composers of colour: the placement and duration of pieces by under-represented composers, and how their additions to the program are represented in marketing materials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this post, I’m going to take a look at these factors with two orchestras from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210530071525/https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;2019/20 Institute for Composer Diversity study&lt;/a&gt; that ranked highly for representation of composers of colour: Chicago Sinfonietta, which was the highest ranked of all 120 orchestras in the study, and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, which ranked the highest among the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/analyses-of-orchestra-seasons.html#group-of-21-big-orchestras&quot;&gt;“Baltimore Group”&lt;/a&gt; of 21 big US orchestras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This also gives me an excuse to use my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/programming/2021/07/03/building-orchestra-season-visualization-tool.html&quot;&gt;tool for fancy season graphs&lt;/a&gt; which will help to highlight placement and duration of pieces. In order to make the graphs, I added some supplemental information to the data collected by ICD in order to organize repertoire into concert programs and to determine the order and duration of pieces within each concert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;chicago-sinfonietta&quot;&gt;Chicago Sinfonietta&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;No surprise that the Sinfonietta topped the ICD’s list for representation of composers of colour: self-described as a “defiantly different kind of orchestra”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/howard-reich/ct-ent-inclusion-sinfonietta-0927-20200925-sll7owag25etdaib2kbwjtdvma-story.html&quot;&gt;the ensemble is well known&lt;/a&gt; for having repertoire, musicians, leadership, and an audience that reflects the diversity of their namesake city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;placement-and-duration&quot;&gt;Placement and Duration&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Composers of colour are found on every concert in their 2019/20 season, and most concerts feature significant works by composers of colour as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-19364932&quot; title=&quot;Chicago Sinfonietta 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/Chicago Sinfonietta/chicago-sinfonietta-19-20-poc.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their desire to be “on the cutting edge of classical music” also makes the Sinfonietta one of two orchestras in the study where more than half of the pieces featured are by living composers. The season opens with &lt;em&gt;Earth Triptych&lt;/em&gt;, a three-part commission and collaboration between composers Stephan Smith, Michelle Isaac, and Fernando Arroyo. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/ct-nvs-ent-chicago-sinfonietta-1004-20190925-m7s2ld4sjbck3oqy4flvj74cae-story.html&quot;&gt;According to Isaac&lt;/a&gt;, the three movements represent “the past, present and future of the Earth and our relationship to it” as part of an opening concert that focuses on the environment and climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A second commission featured later in the season is Courtney Bryan’s &lt;em&gt;Syzygy&lt;/em&gt;, named after the astronomical phenomenon of when the sun, moon, and earth are aligned in a straight line. In this case, the piece takes its inspiration from three artists: Alma Thomas, Frida Kahlo, and Maya Ying Lin, as part of an art-themed program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-432261&quot; title=&quot;Chicago Sinfonietta 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/Chicago Sinfonietta/chicago-sinfonietta-19-20-living.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;The significant number of living composers also brings a number of women composers onto the season, with major pieces such as Gabriela Lena Frank’s &lt;em&gt;Leyendas: An Andean Walkabout”&lt;/em&gt; in addition to Bryan’s commission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-36475124&quot; title=&quot;Chicago Sinfonietta 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/Chicago Sinfonietta/chicago-sinfonietta-19-20-women.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-sell-concerts-with-titles-and-trees&quot;&gt;How to Sell Concerts with Titles and Trees&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re the head of marketing for a symphony orchestra. How do you come up with titles for each concert program?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One common approach would be to highlight the name(s) of the repertoire, conductor, soloist, or a combination, based on what you think will sell the most tickets. For example, the Sinfonietta’s opening concert could have been titled &lt;em&gt;Mei-Ann Chen conducts Beethoven 5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the Sinfonietta is a little more creative with their concert titles and actually named their opening concert &lt;em&gt;Forces + Fates: The Beauty and Volatility of Planet Earth&lt;/em&gt;. This thematic approach is also a popular way to title concerts, though often “thematic” titles aren’t as creative as this one. I feel like I’ve seen something something “Russian Masters” out in the wild often enough for concerts that would have Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff both on the program, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you really wanted to push it up a notch, you could pick a concert title based on… vibes? I haven’t seen many orchestras do this, but there are lots of online streaming playlists that get into this zone, with names like “It’s a Bop” and “Mood Ring”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might well ask “what does Beethoven 5 have to do with the environment?” I don’t know, but “Forces + Fates” fits the piece pretty well. There’s also a lot of “struggle” metaphor within the piece, and isn’t the struggle to keep a livable and healthy planet the main thing you think about when you think about the environment?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With full commitment to the theme, the Sinfonietta gave audience members a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walderfoundation.org/news/forces-fates-the-beauty-and-volatility-of-planet-earth&quot;&gt;demonstration during the intermission&lt;/a&gt; on how to plant a tree, with saplings available to take home. I love this idea. “Where’d you get that tree from?” “Oh, you know, a Beethoven concert…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though a Sinfonietta season looks very different than most orchestra seasons, the “canon” still plays a significant role in their programming, with performances of Beethoven 5, &lt;em&gt;Pictures at an Exhibition&lt;/em&gt;, and the last movement from Gustav Mahler’s second “Resurrection” symphony. However, the repertoire alongside it, plus the thematic approach to concert naming, puts the canonical pieces in a totally different context. A normal performance of the Resurrection symphony would probably be more of a provocation about faith than a statement on politics, but Resurrection played alongside Joel Thompson’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Last_Words_of_the_Unarmed&quot;&gt;The Seven Last Words of the Unarmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as part of the MLK Tribute program transforms the piece into having a different kind of meaning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;cincinnati-symphony-orchestra&quot;&gt;Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, Cincinnati ranks the highest among the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/analyses-of-orchestra-seasons.html#group-of-21-big-orchestras&quot;&gt;“Baltimore Group”&lt;/a&gt; of 21 big US orchestras for representation of composers of colour; however, it achieves this distinction in an interesting and unusual way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;placement-and-duration-1&quot;&gt;Placement and Duration&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cincinnati’s season has 21 programs, so I’m going to switch to a denser graph. If you want to see the full details for each program, they’re still available using the “Explore” button.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one really long concert that pushes out the x-axis is an all-Beethoven marathon show that’s probably about 3.5 hours long. No-one gets a tree in that one, but I sure hope they get more than one intermission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-66137423&quot; title=&quot;Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/Cincinnati/cincinnati-19-20-poc.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other thing that stands out is the one program featuring all composers of colour: &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210126062334/https://www.cincinnatisymphony.org/tickets-and-events/buy-tickets/cso/1920-cso-season/american-life/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by Cincinnati’s Music Director, Louis Langrée. It’s quite a statement &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and includes lengthier works such as William Grant Still’s Symphony No. 1 and Florence Price’s one-movement piano concerto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the three other programs featuring a work by a composer of colour, Unsuk Chin’s 2009 cello concerto stands out as another substantial work. Paired with Franz Peter Schubert’s ninth symphony &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and conducted by Australian conductor Simone Young, it’s quite the challenge to perform. The TSO’s Joseph Johnson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/2019/03/19/primer-the-team-behind-esprit-orchestras-grand-slam-reminds-us-whats-at-stake/&quot;&gt;who performed the concerto in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, apparently took a whole month off and spent a week in Banff in order to prepare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-19695496&quot; title=&quot;Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/Cincinnati/cincinnati-19-20-women.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chin’s cello concerto is also the longest piece by a woman composer on the season, in good company with pieces by Julia Wolfe, Caroline Shaw, Julia Adolphe, and the Florence Price piano concerto, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caroline Shaw’s &lt;em&gt;The Observatory&lt;/em&gt; particularly caught my attention. It’s inspired by the Griffith Observatory in LA, which I know because it was heavily featured in a big &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/em&gt; two-parter (“Future’s End”) where they do the old “travel back in time and wander around a city trying to act normal”, except unlike Star Trek IV, no whales are acquired at the end &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The piece itself feels grand and expansive, with some interesting use of time signatures and a part around eleven minutes in where the orchestra has a duel of sorts with the organ. Caroline Shaw also won the Grammy for Best Contemporary Classical Composition last year for a piece titled &lt;em&gt;Narrow Sea&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also makes me wonder if Xian Zhang, the conductor who was scheduled to conduct the program, has a thing for space-themed music. Last time I saw her here in Toronto, she was conducting the Canadian premiere of Nokuthula Ngwenyama’s &lt;em&gt;Primal Message&lt;/em&gt;, which takes its inspiration from ideas about communicating with other beings out there in the universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Needs some fiddling with the CSS to make it work (e.g. H2 adds its own padding under the heading div) --&gt; &lt;!-- also needs inclusion of footer; add to post template --&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-primary&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel-primary panel-heading&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023 Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sadly, 2019/20 appears to have been the high water mark for Cincinnati’s programming of women composers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wophil.org/2023-2024-season-by-the-numbers/&quot;&gt;Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy&lt;/a&gt; has continued to track Cincinnati’s programming year by year and has documented a decline in the number of women composers featured, settling now at about half of the number Cincinnati included in their 2019/20 season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Cincinnati-Symphony-WoPhil-FY18-FY24.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alt Text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wophil.org/2023-2024-season-by-the-numbers/&quot;&gt;WPA’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra is only performing four works not by men – which seems to be the number that they’ve settled on as “acceptable”. They will perform pieces by Florence Price, Grażyna Bacewicz, Kaija Saariaho, and inti figgis-vizueta. Notably, figgis-vizueta identifies as non-binary, making their inclusion the first presences of a gender-expansive person in our reports. So works by women and non-binary people comprise a total of 8.88% of their programming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;iframe id=&quot;iframe-8936528&quot; title=&quot;Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra 2019/20 Season&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Graphs/Cincinnati/cincinnati-19-20-living.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;Representation of women composers and living composers in the Cincinnati season remains in the top 3–5 of the Baltimore group, but with a more common pattern where most of the pieces are shorter and at the beginning of programs. Don’t be late if you want to hear these pieces!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;for-big-orchestras-subscribers-dont-experience-seasons-they-experience-the-concerts-they-buy&quot;&gt;For Big Orchestras, Subscribers Don’t Experience “Seasons”, They Experience the Concerts They Buy&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The interesting thought experiment for Cincinnati is what kinds of composers you would hear depending on which subscription package you bought. A small digression for context:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a relatively small orchestra, a season subscription generally buys you all of the concerts the orchestra will perform that year. Go a little bigger, and maybe a subscription is for all of the concerts of a certain type (e.g. core classical, pops). If you wanted to buy a classical subscription from a smaller orchestra, the only choice you might make would be which day of the week to attend, i.e. whether to buy the “Thursday” subscription or the “Saturday” one &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you get to larger orchestras that operate nearly year-round, the number of core classical programs might climb into the double digits. This is more than most people would be inclined to purchase, so you have to divide up the programs into different packages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some orchestras, like the TSO, this is complicated by the fact that the number of concerts in each program varies. At the low end, you might have a one-night program by a visiting orchestra, and at the high end, you might have four performances in a week for something popular like Beethoven 5 or &lt;em&gt;Carmina Burana&lt;/em&gt;. Turning all this into a basket of packages that all have seven concerts each and where all the concerts are reasonably spread out throughout the year requires some careful planning. Gnarly spreadsheets are involved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cincinnati’s situation is somewhere in the middle: they have 21 programs, but without the varying number of concert dates that makes the TSO’s schedule complicated, so the programs are neatly divided into three subscription packages. Looking at the 22/23 season materials, there’s varying flavour text for each series, but they don’t seem to be that clearly differentiated &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, it doesn’t seem to be the case that one series is predominantly classical era stuff and another series is much more late Romantic/modern. It’s just a case of “we have more programs than most people want to buy, so let’s divide them up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The end result is that even though Cincinnati had the most composers of colour of any big US orchestra, the audience experience of this statistical fact would depend a lot on which series you buy. If you bought Series 1, you get the &lt;em&gt;American Life&lt;/em&gt; concert and the Unsuk Chin cello concerto. If you bought Series 2, there are no composers of colour at all. If you bought Series 3, you get two short pieces by Duke Ellington and George Walker (and the bladder-busting Beethoven marathon).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have wrung their hands over the decline in subscription sales for decades, but it’s still the case that for a big US orchestra like Cincinnati, over half of “core classical” tickets are sold on subscription. This means that package design plays a big role in how a significant number of audience members experience the season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not to say that Cincinnati’s approach is bad! It means that composers of colour get to take over prime real estate in the back half, and the fact that &lt;em&gt;American Life&lt;/em&gt; is conducted by their Music Director sends a clear message about their institutional priorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a marketing perspective, it also means that you get a concert where the tagline is “The CSO follows the thread of great African American composers” and flavour text stating that William Grant Still and Florence Price “changed the landscape of American orchestral music”. (As opposed to “Guy conducts Beethoven 5” and maybe one of Florence Price’s pieces is picked as a short opener.) It challenges the audience with a question about what the canon is and who’s in it in a way an opening fanfare never could. But only for those that bought a Series 1 package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;up-next&quot;&gt;Up Next&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m planning on doing a similar post with ROCO &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the Philadelphia Orchestra who were highest ranked in a similar way, but for women composers. If you think the Chicago Sinfonietta’s arboreal antics are unique, ROCO has a babysitting service!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Performed in November, not in February for those who were curious… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also Maurice Ravel’s &lt;em&gt;Pavane pour une infante défunte&lt;/em&gt; (Pavane for a Dead Princess), which is a pretty incredible and beautiful solo feature for French Horn. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Doctor does gain the ability to leave medbay, though that’s more of a gift to the writers than to the fictional crew. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also orchestras that travel around to different venues to serve a bigger region. For example, the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony in Ontario has a &lt;em&gt;Baroque &amp;amp; Beyond&lt;/em&gt; series where one concert in each program is performed in Waterloo, Guelph, and Cambridge respectively. The Okanagan Symphony in British Columbia similarly tours each program around to Kelowna, Vernon, and Penticton. In these cases, the relevant choice is about which location is convenient, not which day of the week you prefer. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;I buy a curated subscription where the concerts are pre-selected each year, but the lack of differentiation really baffles me. Partially because if you don’t have a decent knowledge of which repertoire and artists you like, you might as well pick at random. Unless you have a really strong preference for seeing the symphony on a consistent day of the week, which… sure? But then the main differentiator between packages is which habitual schedule you find most convenient, which has very little to do with the music itself. If there was a “mostly late romantic” package, I would totally buy it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Formerly the River Oaks Chamber Orchestra, but now just “ROCO”. They’re based in Houston, TX. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Music"/><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Cincinnati-Symphony-WoPhil-FY18-FY24.png"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Cincinnati-Symphony-WoPhil-FY18-FY24.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">2022 Orchestra Repertoire Report Roundup</title><link href="https://tallcoleman.me/music/2022/10/20/orchestra-repertoire-report-roundup.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2022 Orchestra Repertoire Report Roundup"/><published>2022-10-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-10-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://tallcoleman.me/music/2022/10/20/orchestra-repertoire-report-roundup</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tallcoleman.me/music/2022/10/20/orchestra-repertoire-report-roundup.html">&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2020/12/30/exploring-orchestral-music-race-gender-representation-composers.html&quot;&gt;wrote about race and gender representation among orchestral composers&lt;/a&gt;, and put together a small list of repertoire studies. It’s since grown into its own page that I update now and again with additional entries, but the number and depth of these studies has really grown over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal of this post is to dig deeper into some of the recent entries, showcase their main results, and add some additional commentary. The results from many of these studies, along with the evolution of the studies themselves, has been interesting to observe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-info&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel-info panel-heading&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Report List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full page with links to all the orchestra repertoire reports mentioned in this post and previous posts can be accessed here: &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/analyses-of-orchestra-seasons.html&quot;&gt;Analyses of Orchestra Seasons - List &amp;amp; Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;institute-for-composer-diversity-202122&quot;&gt;Institute for Composer Diversity 2021/22&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ICD’s 2019/20 study of US orchestra seasons was a landmark piece of analysis. It was significantly larger than many preceding studies, with 120 US ensembles included, and it was the first (that I was aware of) to record and analyze the race of composers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.composerdiversity.com/analysis&quot;&gt;Their newest report&lt;/a&gt; focused on the 2021/22 season (skipping the 2020/21 pandemic season), and expanded the sample size slightly to 133 US orchestras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the achievement their first report represented, it’s odd that it’s now been memory-holed from their website, though you can still view the results thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20201019051312/https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons&quot;&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;. The top-line results of their 2019/20 study are also included in the 2021/22 report, along with results from the two larger Ricky O’Bannon / Baltimore Symphony studies, giving a time series of trends from four points over about six years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;main-findings&quot;&gt;Main Findings&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The big story from this report is that leading up to 2021/22, there had been significant growth in the number of women composers, composers of colour, or both programmed by US orchestras in the preceding six years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/ICD 2021-22 composers of colour and women composers graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph showing the proportion of composers of colour increasing from 3.2% in 2015/16 to 16.8% in 2021/22 and the proportion of women composers increasing from 1.6% in 2015/16 to 11.7% in 2021/22&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There had also been a notable increase in the number of living composers programmed, driven entirely by an increase in living composers who are women, people of colour, or both (the proportion of pieces by living white male composers declined very slightly).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/ICD 2021-22 living composers with breakdown graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph showing increases in works programmed by Living Men of Colour, Living White Women, and Living Women of Colour while works programmed by Living White Men decline slightly&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also includes breakdowns by region and by budget size, and suggests that neither have a clear impact on outcomes. For example, the numbers for women composers and composers of colour were very similar for orchestras in the northeast and the southeast of the USA, even though there are significant cultural differences between the communities in these regions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;other-interesting-observations&quot;&gt;Other Interesting Observations&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2021/22 report also included some information about which composers are frequently programmed: Jessie Montgomery and Florence Price were the most-programmed women of colour composers, Lili Boulanger and Anna Clyne were the most programmed white women composers, and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and William Grant Still were the most programmed men of colour composers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new report was also more of a team effort, with financial support from the Sphinx Organization and institutional support from the League of American Orchestras. Unlike in 2019/20, there was no published dataset, and no results for individual orchestras. I suppose the upshot is that this report will probably have more sector engagement due to the League’s support, but — combined with the removal of the detailed 2019/20 results — it offers less accountability for individual orchestras. However, numbers for individual orchestras can still be gleaned from several other reports, such as the ones published by DONNE - Women in Music, Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy, and Tom Hogglestock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of published data is frustrating, because it removes the potential to explore other questions, such how conductors might influence which composers are programmed, or whether the durations and program placements for under-represented composers are changing. It also removes the potential for future re-use, which is ironic given that the study re-uses Ricky O’Bannon’s data, which he had made freely available on the Baltimore website. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from the lack of published data, their methodology description is among the best from recent studies, with a clear indication of which orchestras were included (US orchestras in the League of American Orchestra’s top five budget groups), and which performances (mainstage “classical” or “masterworks” series).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;donne-202122-and-202021&quot;&gt;DONNE 2021/22 (and 2020/21)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After two years of doing small-scale reports on 15 orchestras, DONNE significantly expanded their efforts last year with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://donne-uk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Equality-Diversity-in-Concert-Halls-DonneUK.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2020/21 study of 100 orchestras&lt;/a&gt;. Since the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the results are a bit challenging to contextualize (especially for individual orchestras), but the overall and regional results are very interesting &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://donne-uk.org/research-new/&quot;&gt;study on the 2021/22 season&lt;/a&gt; (email-walled) continued with this ambitious scope, including a sample set of 111 orchestras from across the world. The 2021/22 study also benefits from improved methodology for categorizing the race of composers as well as a data set less jumbled by the chaos of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although both studies include data on individual orchestras, the regional results are what I find most interesting and useful from the DONNE studies. This is partially because the scope of works included is not as consistent as other studies: for example, galas, tours, and family concerts are included, but only when the full repertoire information was published by a particular orchestra. Whether repertoire from Pops programs was included is unclear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;observations-by-region&quot;&gt;Observations by Region&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;iframe title=&quot;Median % of works by women and non-binary composers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Range Plot&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-nyugh&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nyugh/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;286&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DONNE reports illustrate that leading up to 2021/22, increases in the proportion of women composers were a relatively global phenomenon, though representation of women and non-binary &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; composers was significantly higher in English-speaking regions. The significant growth in the average for Oceana may be somewhat over-stated due to the sample, which we’ll come back to when we get to the Living Music Report on Australian orchestras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also want to show the top five for 2021/22 because it’s a great example of how averages don’t always show the whole story. Judging by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mundoclasico.com/articulo/29733/The-Royal-Stockholm-Philharmonic-Orchestra%E2%80%99s-2017-18-season&quot;&gt;story from 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra may have featured a significant number of women composers for several years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Orchestra (DONNE 2021/22)&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;% of works by Women and Non-Binary composers&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chicago Sinfonietta&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;50.0%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;National Philharmonic (USA)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;40.5%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Melbourne Symphony Orchestra&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;25.0%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Adelaide Symphony Orchestra&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;21.9%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;21.6%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;iframe title=&quot; Median % of works by composers of colour&quot; aria-label=&quot;Arrow Plot&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-AUU8d&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AUU8d/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;DONNE’s numbers on composers of colour are harder to assess because the definitions used changed significantly between the 2020/21 and 2021/22 studies. The 2020/21 study only included percentages for “Black and Asian” composers, whereas the 2021/22 study uses a broader “global majority” definition for traditionally underrepresented races. Their global majority numbers were inclusive of composers who are “Black, Asian, Brown, dual-heritage, indigenous to the global south, and/or have been referred to as “ethnic minorities”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, the increases in regional averages seen in the chart below are likely a combination of genuine increases in composers of colour being programmed as well as a greater number of composers being included in DONNE’s definition. I suspect “definition growth” may be particularly prominent for South American ensembles, though I don’t know for sure. Regardless, the numbers for their US and Canadian orchestras seem to be roughly in the right ballpark based on other sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;References to Indigenous composers in the 2021/22 report are slightly confusing: I presume their numeric breakdowns for Indigenous composers are intended to reflect composers who are Indigenous peoples as understood in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, but their definition of global majority composers only includes people who are “indigenous to the global south”, which seems to imply something different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;interesting-questions&quot;&gt;Interesting Questions&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;These numbers leave me with a couple things I’m curious about:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, how many of the global majority composers in Asia and South America are local composers from those regions compared to composers of colour from other regions? To what extent is their programming reflective of global multiculturalism versus a sense of local or national identity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, are there any notable differences for ensembles that have music directors/principal conductors who hold titled positions in both English-speaking and non-English-speaking regions? Do some pieces they’ve conducted with one ensemble get programmed in their other region as well? Does this ever happen with conductors who frequently guest in different regions as well?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This question also made me think of the Globe and Mail’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/theatre-and-performance/article-cocs-alexander-neef-accused-of-importing-cancel-culture-to-france-in/&quot;&gt;coverage of Alexander Neef’s efforts to diversify the Paris Opera&lt;/a&gt; (paywalled), where he (a German-born administrator who led the Canadian Opera Company from 2008 to 2020) was “accused of importing North American “cancel culture” to France”. I think it’s one interesting illustration of the dynamics at play in the English/non-English divide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also noticed that the 2021/22 DONNE report was supported by funding from Arts Council England, which might indicate a growth in institutional support similar to the ICD 2021/22 study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;living-music-report-australia&quot;&gt;Living Music Report (Australia)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://livingmusic.report/&quot;&gt;Living Music Report&lt;/a&gt; has been running since 2019 and seems to generally include nine orchestras and detailed information on composers that includes living/deceased, nationality, gender, race, and Indigenous identity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favourite thing about this report is that they &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ciaranframe/livingmusicreport&quot;&gt;publish their data on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes piece durations, which is pretty rare. I’ve also published some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tallcoleman/Analysis-Tools-Living-Music-Report&quot;&gt;analysis tools&lt;/a&gt; to generate a single data table from their folder structure and fix some text encoding errors. They also have some &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt; graphic design in their reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://feverpitchmagazine.com/2021/06/20/the-living-music-report/&quot;&gt;interview with the creator&lt;/a&gt;, Ciaran Frame, the report was inspired by an annual blog series put together by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ianwhitney.com.au/2019/11/11/australian-content-in-2020/&quot;&gt;Ian Whitney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can see from their 2021 results, the 2021/22 DONNE study sample over-indexes on orchestras that are leading the pack for representation of women composers, so the massive growth in female representation from the earlier DONNE charts probably exaggerates the extent of change in Australian orchestras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Orchestra (LMR 2021)&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;% of works by Women composers&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melbourne Symphony Orchestra&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33.1%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adelaide Symphony Orchestra&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21.6%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Australian Chamber Orchestra&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;10.0%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;3.1%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Symphony Orchestra&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;West Australian Symphony Orchestra&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;0.9%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Australian Brandenburg Orchestra&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;0.0%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Orchestras included in the 2021/22 DONNE study.&lt;/strong&gt; Queensland Symphony Orchestra was also included in DONNE 2021/22, but LMR numbers for Queensland have not yet been published for 2021. In the 2020 LMR, Queensland had 4.6% of works by women composers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;womens-philharmonic-advocacy&quot;&gt;Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2020/12/30/exploring-orchestral-music-race-gender-representation-composers.html&quot;&gt;noted in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, WPA has been publishing numbers on representation of female composers for 21 US orchestras since 2016/17. Although they don’t publish data on race, they have been paying increasing attention to racial diversity in their commentary for each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August they released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wophil.org/2022-23-repertoire-report/&quot;&gt;report on the 2022/23 season&lt;/a&gt;, and their main conclusion is that growth in the number of pieces by women composers has “leveled off”, with 14.1% of works composed by women compared to 15.1% in 2021/22:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[A]s we explore the programming for individual ensembles, it becomes evident that the pressure that was felt to address programming concerns has leveled off. Many ensembles are performing fewer works by women this year than they did this past season – even taking into consideration the numerous hurdles that the pandemic threw at the performing arts world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I appreciated their analysis of women conductors, where they noted that “though women [conductors] only appeared 13% of the time, they conducted 22% of all the performances of works by women”. This suggests that increased representation for women conductors could — in turn — increase representation for women composers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They astutely note that it’s hard to know how much control individual conductors have over the programs they’re hired to lead; not that this should let established and senior maestros of the hook, since “there are several names that certainly had the choice and the authority to [program women composers], and chose not to”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;tom-hogglestock&quot;&gt;Tom Hogglestock&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tom Hogglestock started &lt;a href=&quot;https://hogglestock.com/2021/07/24/crunching-the-musical-numbers/&quot;&gt;blogging about repertoire numbers in 2021&lt;/a&gt; when he was planning which concerts to see, and expanded his work this summer with a series of five posts about the 2022/23 season:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hogglestock.com/2022/05/10/2022-2023-season-post-i-women-conductors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2022/2023 Season Post I: Women Conductors (May 10, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hogglestock.com/2022/07/15/2022-2023-season-post-ii-composers-of-color/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2022/2023 Season Post II: Works by BIPOC Composers (July 15, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hogglestock.com/2022/07/17/2022-2023-season-post-iii-works-by-women-composers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2022/2023 Season Post III: Works by Women Composers (July 17, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hogglestock.com/2022/07/23/2022-2023-season-post-iv-works-by-u-s-american-composers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2022/2023 Season Post IV: Works by American Composers (July 23, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hogglestock.com/2022/09/11/2022-2023-season-post-v-works-by-living-composers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2022/2023 Season Post V: Works by Living Composers (September 11, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like WPA, he observed a levelling off in the growth of pieces programmed by women composers and composers of colour. Among the 19 orchestras that were included in both years he has made posts, there is very slight growth in the percentage of works by women composers, growing from 12.1% in 2021/22 to 12.4% in 2022/23.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even more concerning, for composers of colour, there is a decline of several percentage points among those 19 orchestras, with 16% of works in 2021/22 and 13.6% in 2022/23.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2022/23 series of posts looks at a larger sample of 51 orchestras, including the 19 that Tom wrote about for 2021/22. The larger sample has top-line numbers that are very close to the numbers for the original 19, though with a slightly higher percentage of works by composers of colour, at 15.1%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;conductors&quot;&gt;Conductors&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like WPA, Tom also notes that there is a correlation between female leadership on the podium and the number of female composers on programs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[T]he five orchestras with women music directors or equivalent (Hartford, Buffalo, Richmond, New Jersey, and Atlanta), have the highest percentage of concerts conducted by women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;18.2% of the pieces women conduct are by women&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;10.3% of the pieces men conduct are by women&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the DONNE section, I had raised the question about the extent to which pieces travel with conductors between orchestras. I took a quick look at the pieces by female composers performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and Orchestre Métropolitain, who are both led by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, just out of curiosity. Between the two ensembles, there were 27 works by female composers, but only one in common (Florence Price’s Symphony No. 3). I’m surprised there’s not more than one piece in common, though perhaps it would be more instructive to look at pieces in common over consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;other-interesting-observations-1&quot;&gt;Other Interesting Observations&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though there are now several reports that include data on US orchestras, it hasn’t gotten to a point where any particular report feels redundant. Tom’s report and the WPA report are both nearly a year ahead of DONNE and ICD, which theoretically means that curators could consider their findings during the process of planning for the next season. (Assuming that most orchestras firm up their programming in the fall before each season.) I like the depth and uniqueness of the commentary in both Tom’s and WPA’s reports as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another unique feature of Tom’s 2022/23 report is that it’s the most comprehensive report on Canadian Orchestras among the ones I’ve seen recently. In addition to Toronto, Vancouver, and Montréal (which are in DONNE), he has Orchestre Métropolitain (which is also based in Montréal), Calgary, and Edmonton. Métropolitain is #1 for women composers and #6 for composers of colour; Toronto and Vancouver are highly-ranked for women composers but middling for composers of colour; and Montréal, Calgary, and Edmonton are in the bottom half or lower for both categories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tom also has some commentary about duration and program order in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://hogglestock.com/2022/09/11/2022-2023-season-post-v-works-by-living-composers/&quot;&gt;post about living composers&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2020/12/30/exploring-orchestral-music-race-gender-representation-composers.html#duration-and-placement&quot;&gt;I also think is important&lt;/a&gt;. He does note that gathering data on this can be quite difficult:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[T]wo days ago, on a long walk through my parents’ neighborhood, in the blistering heat, at six in the morning, I thought, hey, why not just look up the durations for all 2,236 works in my data set, how long can that take? I got as far as Beethoven when I decided to stop. Finding durations for works by living composers was really time consuming and in some cases impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anyone is able to take on this challenge, it would probably be the ICD, assuming they can move to a data collection method in partnership with the League of American Orchestras where ensembles self-report repertoire data. I guarantee you that 99% of League members have work durations in their internal databases already &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the point of these repertoire reports?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You could argue that most people who are familiar with orchestras “know” that they mostly perform repertoire from dead, white men. But there are lots of “known things” that are studied for good reasons: to establish a more detailed account of how things are, to dig into why, to uncover interesting details. Especially with the changes in the last couple of years, putting numbers to what has been happening is informative, and perhaps useful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-drives-change&quot;&gt;What Drives Change?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of these reports also have a clear intent to create or catalyze change, which raises a couple thoughts for me:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, I think it’s worth asking why the ICD didn’t publish results for individual orchestras in their 2021/22 report, and whether this hinders their goal of improving the diversity of composers performed in the US. Was there a trade-off between engaging orchestras more deeply with the legitimacy of formal League support and reducing the opportunity for specific ensembles to be called out?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, is it important to release results before the next season’s programming decisions are made? It would be interesting to interview a cross-section of conductors and artistic administrators and see to what extent the specific results of these studies inform their own internal goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, as an example, what does the journey from 10% to 20% composers of colour look like? What new challenges do orchestras start to face? Buy-in to shared values among musicians and staff is one thing, but I think there are also practical challenges where you have to start doing things differently. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tso.ca/noteworthy/gustavo-gimenos-expansive-programming-explored-2/&quot;&gt;TSO performed “In the Bottoms” last year&lt;/a&gt;, which was written by Nathaniel Dett, a Black Canadian-American composer. It was originally written as a piano suite, and arranged for string orchestra by Gary Kulesha, the TSO’s Composer Advisor. Do orchestras need to invest more into arrangements to make that jump? Also, it’s a lot harder to find commercial recordings of composers who are historically under-represented; how much more work is required to discover and evaluate pieces you might want to add to your programming?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, are there opportunities for these studies to dig deeper into the differences between orchestras that are forging new ground and orchestras that are sticking to their traditional repertoire? I wrote a couple times about the influence that conductors have; does diversity among soloists correlate to diversity among composers as well? Are there institutional factors aside from language and nationality that seem to be aligned with different outcomes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;all-efforts-appreciated&quot;&gt;All Efforts Appreciated&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to end this round-up by appreciating that these reports are a lot of hard work for the people that make them. The data collection alone is a big task, especially for reports like DONNE and ICD which have grown to include over 100 ensembles. All of these reports have started as real labours of love, and several continue to be volunteer efforts, or close to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those that have now garnered sources of funding and institutional backing also have the additional challenges of building sound methodology, dealing sensitively and appropriately with the lived identities of composers, remaining accountable even as they make mistakes, and building themselves a sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, to the people behind these reports who have taken the time to document a part of our culture, and to push for change with data — thank you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report notes that “[The Baltimore Symphony’s] datasets were shared with the Institute through the generous assistance of Ricky O’Bannon, the original author of the BSO’s data analysis initiative.”, but I assume this is due to some combination of (a) the ICD’s authors don’t know about the Wayback Machine, (b) the original links to the data are now dead, or (c) they wanted to get explicit permission to re-use the data. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The core challenge is that the repertoire included in the study represents a mix of orchestra seasons planned before the pandemic which were largely cancelled, as well as re-imagined, largely online programs from during the pandemic. For some ensembles, both kinds of programs might be included. As a result, comparisons between orchestras may be a bit apples and oranges, but comparisons between regions yield some interesting insights. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2020/21 study did not include specific numbers or mention of non-binary composers, but the 2021/22 study did. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many databases like OPAS come with a large data set of work durations built-in, and every artistic team needs to be pretty certain that their total concert duration isn’t going to trigger any overtime clauses in the musicians’ union agreement. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Music"/><summary type="html">A couple years ago, I wrote about race and gender representation among orchestral composers, and put together a small list of repertoire studies.

Ideally you want to be able to print their name on &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; sides of the card so that it’s easily visible. This is how you do it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main trick is to ignore the default template that Word or the Avery website gives you, and to make your own template, &lt;em&gt;sideways&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:why-sideways&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:why-sideways&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;instructions-avery-5305-two-to-a-page-tent-cards&quot;&gt;Instructions: Avery 5305 Two-to-a-Page Tent Cards&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the detailed instructions, I’m using the example of two-to-a-page cards like Avery 5305, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;#other-sizes&quot;&gt;additional instructions at the end&lt;/a&gt; for tent or place cards where you have one, four, or six cards on a page; or for cards from other brands such as St. James Overtures or JAM Paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Needs some fiddling with the CSS to make it work (e.g. H2 adds its own padding under the heading div) --&gt; &lt;!-- also needs inclusion of footer; add to post template --&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-primary&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel-primary panel-heading&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Instructions for Other Sizes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#avery-5309-one-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5309 (one-to-a-page)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#st-james-overtures-tent-cards-two-to-a-page&quot;&gt;St. James Overtures Tent Cards (two-to-a-page)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#avery-5302-four-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5302 (four-to-a-page)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#avery-5011-six-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5011 (six-to-a-page)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#st-james-overtures-place-cards-six-to-a-page&quot;&gt;St. James Overtures Place Cards (six-to-a-page)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#jam-paper-place-cards-six-to-a-page&quot;&gt;JAM Paper place cards (six-to-a-page)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you run into any problems during the steps below, make sure to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;#troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting section&lt;/a&gt; for tips that might help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;set-up&quot;&gt;Set Up&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Tent Card Table Set Up.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Word application window with a four-column table set up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open a new word document and set the layout to Landscape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set the page margins to &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.5&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top and sides, and 0&quot; on the bottom.

You can set cell margins for the whole table by selecting your table and then selecting “Layout” &amp;gt; “Cell Margins” in the ribbon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one thing to note is that adding margin at the top or bottom of a cell increases the the table size, so you have to shorten your cell size by the same amount — see the &lt;a href=&quot;#setting-cell-margin-offsets&quot;&gt;margin offsets section&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;printing&quot;&gt;Printing&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Tent Card Finished Preview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Word application window showing off a preview of the finished set up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the “Mailings” tab, select “Finish and Merge” and then “Edit Individual Documents”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Save the newly-generated file and check to make sure that everything merged correctly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, it’s usually a good idea to try printing just one page to make sure you know how to correctly orient your cards in the feed tray. I usually run it through with a piece of paper that has “Top” written on the top of one side so you can figure out the correct rotation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you’re confident that everything is set up correctly, print out your cards and have fun separating them and folding them up!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;other-sizes&quot;&gt;Other Sizes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;avery-5309-one-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5309 (one-to-a-page)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For one-to-a-page cards like Avery 5309, the correct set-up is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page orientation to portrait;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page margins of &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.5&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top, 0.75&quot; on the sides, and 0&quot; on the bottom;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert a 2 col x 1 row table; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set cell size to 10&quot; tall and 3.5&quot; wide.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Avery 5309 Layout Example.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Word application window showing the layout for Avery 5309&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From here, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;#set-up&quot;&gt;step 4 of Set Up&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure to delete the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Next Record&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in column 2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;st-james-overtures-tent-cards-two-to-a-page&quot;&gt;St. James Overtures Tent Cards (two-to-a-page)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the product information online, St. James Overtures tent cards appear not to have any margin or gutter. However, if you set all page margins to zero, Word will add extra blank pages during the mail merge process, since the invisible Section Break character can’t fit underneath the table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make a mail merge file that avoids this blank page problem, we can add 0.25&quot; of space at the top and bottom with the following set-up:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page orientation to landscape;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page margins of &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.25&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top, 0&quot; on the sides, and 0&quot; on the bottom;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert a 4 col x 1 row table; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set the cell sizes to 8&quot; tall and 2.75&quot; wide.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;From here, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;#set-up&quot;&gt;step 4 of Set Up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;avery-5302-four-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5302 (four-to-a-page)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The set-up for Avery 5302 cards is as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page orientation to landscape;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page margins of &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.5&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top, 1.0&quot; on the sides, and 0&quot; on the bottom;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert a 4 col x 2 row table; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set cell size to 3.5&quot; tall and 2.25&quot; wide.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’ll then need to &lt;a href=&quot;#setting-cell-margin-offsets&quot;&gt;set cell margin offsets&lt;/a&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Columns 1, 3: Left offset of 0.25&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Columns 2, 4: Right offset of 0.25&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Row 1: Bottom offset of 0.25&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Row 2: Top offset of 0.25&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Avery 5302 New Layout Example with Table Dimensions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Word application window showing the table dimensions for Avery 5302&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From here, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;#set-up&quot;&gt;step 4 of Set Up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Avery 5302 New Layout Example with Merge Tags.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Word application window showing the merge tag layout for Avery 5302&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;avery-5011-six-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5011 (six-to-a-page)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The set-up for Avery 5011 cards is as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page orientation to landscape;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page margins of &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.33&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top, 1.44&quot; on the left, 0.56&quot; on the right, and 0&quot; on the bottom;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert a 6 col x 2 row table; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set cell size to 3.75&quot; tall and 1.5&quot; wide.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’ll then need to &lt;a href=&quot;#setting-cell-margin-offsets&quot;&gt;set cell margin offsets&lt;/a&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Columns 1, 3, 5: Left offset of 0.07&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Columns 2, 4, 6: Right offset of 0.07&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Row 1: Bottom offset of 0.17&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Row 2: Top offset of 0.17&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Avery 5011 Layout Example with Table Dimensions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Word application window showing the table dimensions for Avery 5011&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From here, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;#set-up&quot;&gt;step 4 of Set Up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Avery 5011 Layout Example with Merge Tags.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Word application window showing the merge tag layout for Avery 5302&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;st-james-overtures-place-cards-six-to-a-page&quot;&gt;St. James Overtures place cards (six-to-a-page)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s hard for me to see online whether this has margins at the top and bottom (when you’re looking at it in portrait orientation). So you’ll have to check and test if you buy it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it does have top/bottom margins (I’m assuming 0.25&quot; based on the advertised dimensions), the set-up is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page orientation to landscape;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page margins of &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.25&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top, 0.25&quot; on the sides, and 0&quot; on the bottom;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert a 6 col x 2 row table;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set cell size to 3.75&quot; tall and 1.75&quot; wide; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#setting-cell-margin-offsets&quot;&gt;Set cell margin offsets&lt;/a&gt; as follows: row 1: bottom offset of 0.25&quot;; row 2: top offset of 0.25&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t have any tear-off margins, the set-up is likely as follows with the changes in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page orientation to landscape;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page margins of &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.25&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top, &lt;strong&gt;0&quot; on the sides&lt;/strong&gt;, and 0&quot; on the bottom;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert a 6 col x 2 row table;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set the cell sizes to 3.75&quot; tall and &lt;strong&gt;1.83&quot; wide&lt;/strong&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#setting-cell-margin-offsets&quot;&gt;Set cell margin offsets&lt;/a&gt; as follows: row 1: bottom offset of 0.25&quot;; row 2: top offset of 0.25&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;After figuring out which one is the right set-up, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;#set-up&quot;&gt;step 4 of Set Up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;jam-paper-place-cards-six-to-a-page&quot;&gt;JAM Paper place cards (six-to-a-page)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The set-up for these cards is as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page orientation to landscape;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set page margins of &lt;abbr title=&quot;inches&quot;&gt;0.5&quot;&lt;/abbr&gt; on the top, 0.25&quot; on the sides, and 0&quot; on the bottom;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert a 6 col x 2 row table; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Set cell size to 3.75&quot; tall and 1.75&quot; wide.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;JAM Paper place cards appear to not have a gutter, so no &lt;a href=&quot;#setting-cell-margin-offsets&quot;&gt;cell margin offsets&lt;/a&gt; are needed. However, if you add padding on the top or bottom of table cells, make sure to reduce the cell size by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From here, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;#set-up&quot;&gt;step 4 of Set Up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-cell-margin-offsets&quot;&gt;Setting Cell Margin Offsets&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For templates with four or six cards per page, you may have to set specific margins for different rows and columns in your table to account for the gutter (space) between cards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Word, you can either set margins at the &lt;em&gt;table&lt;/em&gt; level (i.e. the same margins for all cells), or at the &lt;em&gt;cell&lt;/em&gt; level (specific margins that might be different from cell to cell). In this case, we want to set the margins at the cell level &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:cell-overrides-table&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:cell-overrides-table&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To do this, you can set per-cell settings using Word’s “Cell Options” dialog. To get to Cell Options, you can select your desired table cells, right-click, select “Table Properties…”, go to the “Cell” tab, and then select “Options…”. The “Cell Options” dialog will then open; with this menu, you can uncheck Cell margins “Same as the whole table” and then set specific margins for your selected cells only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Needs some fiddling with the CSS to make it work (e.g. H2 adds its own padding under the heading div) --&gt; &lt;!-- also needs inclusion of footer; add to post template --&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-info&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel-info panel-heading&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;💡 &lt;strong&gt;Tip: Select Multiple Discontinuous Cells At Once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To select multiple cells that are not next to each other, e.g. cells in both column 1 and column 3 of a table, hold down the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ctrl&lt;/code&gt; key on Windows or the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; key on Mac.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-cell-options-to-your-quick-access-toolbar&quot;&gt;Adding Cell Options To Your Quick Access Toolbar&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since it takes a lot of steps to open the Cell Options dialog, you may want to add it to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/customize-the-quick-access-toolbar-43fff1c9-ebc4-4963-bdbd-c2b6b0739e52&quot;&gt;Quick Access Toolbar&lt;/a&gt; with the following steps:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Windows, select “File”, then “Options”, then “Quick Access Toolbar”.

Find and select “Cell Options…” in the left column, and then select the “Add &amp;gt;&amp;gt;” button in the middle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Mac, select “Word”, then “Preferences”. Select “Ribbon &amp;amp; Toolbar” and then choose the “Quick Access Toolbar” tab at the top. Using the drop-down at the top-left, select Choose commands from: “Commands Not in the Ribbon”. Find and select “Table Cell Options” in the left column, and then select the “&amp;gt;” button in the middle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Select “OK” or “Save” to return to Word, and a circle icon should appear at the very top that opens the “Cell Options” dialog directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;calculating-offsets&quot;&gt;Calculating Offsets&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When adding margin offsets, you will need to add the offset &lt;em&gt;in addition to&lt;/em&gt; any cell margin you want to set. You will also have to adjust table row heights to offset any margin you add at the top or bottom of a cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll show you how to make these adjustments with two examples using the &lt;a href=&quot;#avery-5302-four-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5302 (four-to-a-page) template&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;example-1-offset-margin-only&quot;&gt;Example 1: Offset Margin Only&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Follow the first four bullet points in the &lt;a href=&quot;#avery-5302-four-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5302 instructions&lt;/a&gt; to set your page orientation and margins, insert a 4x2 table, and set the cell size. Then select the entire table and set all the margins to zero using Cell Options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice that the margin at the bottom of the page currently appears to be larger than the margin at the top — this is because the cell height of 3.5&quot; intentionally excludes the two 0.25&quot; offsets we will be adding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To add the row offsets, select row 1 of the table, and then set the bottom margin to 0.25&quot; using Cell Options. Then select row 2 and set its top margin to 0.25&quot;. The margins at the top and bottom of the page should now look the same size because Word includes top and bottom cell margins &lt;em&gt;in addition to&lt;/em&gt; your cell dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To add the column offset, hold down &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ctrl&lt;/code&gt; (Windows) or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; (Mac) and select columns 1 and 3. Using Cell Options, set the left margin to 0.25&quot;. Then select columns 2 and 4, and set their right margin to 0.25&quot;. Notice that the width of the table has not changed — this is because Word includes left and right cell margins &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; your cell dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In summary, adding top and bottom cell margins makes your table taller, but adding left and right cell margins does not make your table wider. So you only need to worry about top and bottom margins when calculating the cell sizes you need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;example-2-custom-and-offset-margins-together&quot;&gt;Example 2: Custom and Offset Margins Together&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s say that we want to have a margin of 0.1&quot; in our cells in addition to the offsets so that long text doesn’t run all the way to the edge. We can do this as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like before, follow the first four bullet points in the &lt;a href=&quot;#avery-5302-four-to-a-page&quot;&gt;Avery 5302 instructions&lt;/a&gt; to set your page orientation and margins, insert a 4x2 table, and set the cell size. Then select the entire table and this time, set all the margins to 0.1&quot; using Cell Options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the custom margins, we’ve now added an additional 0.1&quot; at the top and 0.1&quot; at the bottom, which means we need to make our cells 0.2&quot; shorter to compensate. To do that, select the entire table, and set the cell size to 3.3&quot; tall instead of 3.5&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; our offsets to the existing margins, so each margin with an offset will be set at 0.35&quot; (0.1&quot; margin + 0.25&quot; offset):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Columns 1, 3: Left margin of 0.35&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Columns 2, 4: Right margin of 0.35&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Row 1: Bottom margin of 0.35&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Row 2: Top margin of 0.35&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;With everything done correctly, the table dimensions should look exactly the same as before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-merged-document-doesnt-print&quot;&gt;My merged document doesn’t print&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how common this issue is, but I’ve run into it occasionally.

This will force Word to re-pull the data from the spreadsheet file.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;i-put-in-the-right-dimensions-for-the-table-but-after-styling-my-text-the-dimensions-have-changed&quot;&gt;I put in the right dimensions for the table, but after styling my text, the dimensions have changed&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setting Layout &amp;gt; Autofit to “Fixed Column Width” might help, but in most cases, you’ll just have to re-set the table layout to the correct dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;i-find-the-some-margins-are-outside-the-printable-area-of-the-page-warning-annoying&quot;&gt;I find the “some margins are outside the printable area of the page” warning annoying&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This warning comes up any time you have a page margin set to 0&quot; because most printers can’t print all the way to the edge of a page. However, we usually set our bottom margin 0&quot; to prevent blank pages from being generated when you do your mail merge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your template requires you to have 0&quot; page margins on the sides, then there’s no easy way around this warning. If the warning is popping up while you’re trying to print, try exporting to PDF and printing from the PDF instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it’s only your bottom page margin that’s 0&quot;, there are a couple alternative options you can try:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Option A: select “fix” when the “outside printable area” warning comes up, and re-open the page margin options to make sure your top, left, and right margins haven’t changed. If you end up with a second blank page after your table, select the blank paragraph on the second page, and set the font size to be really small (e.g. 5pt or 2pt). Once the blank paragraph is small enough, the second blank page should go away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Option B: Select the blank paragraph on the second page, open the Format &amp;gt; Font dialog, and check “Hidden”. As long as the “Show Invisibles” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:show-invisibles&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:show-invisibles&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; option isn’t turned on, the second page should go away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:why-sideways&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main problem is that while Word can have text oriented 90 degrees sideways in either direction, it can’t orient text upside down. You can make upside down text using a text box, but that doesn’t seem to play well with the mail merge feature. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:why-sideways&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:cell-overrides-table&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The interaction between table and cell settings can be a bit complicated. Any cell with “Same as the whole table” unchecked becomes completely disconnected from the table-level settings, and table-level left and right margins won’t affect these cells. However, top or bottom margins appear to affect an entire table row, regardless of whether they’re set at the table level, or whether they’re set on just one cell in a row. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:cell-overrides-table&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:show-invisibles&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;i.e. the pilcrow button (¶) that shows things like spaces, tab marks, and — relevant to this case — hidden text. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:show-invisibles&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Crafts"/><summary type="html">Updated June 23, 2023 with more detailed instructions for other sizes and brands.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">Experimenting with RGB Colours for Cosmo Embroidery Floss</title><link href="https://tallcoleman.me/crafts/2022/01/01/experimenting-rgb-colours-cosmo-embroidery-floss.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Experimenting with RGB Colours for Cosmo Embroidery Floss"/><published>2022-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://tallcoleman.me/crafts/2022/01/01/experimenting-rgb-colours-cosmo-embroidery-floss</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tallcoleman.me/crafts/2022/01/01/experimenting-rgb-colours-cosmo-embroidery-floss.html">&lt;!-- Needs some fiddling with the CSS to make it work (e.g. H2 adds its own padding under the heading div) --&gt; &lt;!-- also needs inclusion of footer; add to post template --&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-primary&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel-primary panel-heading&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downloadable list of Cosmo RGB and Hex Colours&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking for a list of RGB or Hex colours for the 2020 Cosmo embroidery floss collection?

She wanted to be able to see how many of each colour she owned at a glance, and what kind of inventory she had on hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was provided with a helpful diagram:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Embroidery_Floss_Inventory_Diagram.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Layout diagram which includes thread code, a colour box, and types of inventory on hand&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some discussion, we decided on trying to mimic the layout of the 2020 colour card &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/cosmo_colour_card_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full Cosmo colour card&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal was to make an inventory dashboard with the same layout as the colour card. This all seemed easy enough, until I got to the problem of finding RGB colours for each thread…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are some lists out there that will give you RGB colours for Cosmo threads, but they’re much harder to find than lists for DMC (which is a more widely-used brand). &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs-pattern.com/cosmo-list.php&quot;&gt;cs-pattern.com&lt;/a&gt; has a good list, but they only have 400 colours as a result of sampling from an older colour card, as you can see their &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs-pattern.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=234&quot;&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;. I later discovered that MacStitch also ships with a list of Cosmo threads, but it’s also slightly out of date and a little tricky to convert to RGB hex codes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another, worse option I tried before finding the cs-pattern list was to use a conversion chart to get an equivalent DMC thread for each Cosmo thread &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which then allowed me to get a RGB colour from a DMC list. This filled in about half of the colours from the 2020 Cosmo colour card, leaving the other half for me to fill in manually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, none of these options worked and I ended up sampling my own Cosmo to RGB dataset from the 2020 colour card PDF using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt;. (Download via GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tallcoleman/CosmoToRGB&quot;&gt;500 colour Cosmo dataset&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along the way, I learned some interesting things, which are described below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-1-you-usually-cant-mix-data-sources&quot;&gt;Problem #1: You (usually) can’t mix data sources&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I assume that most thread to RGB colour conversion charts are created by sampling an RGB colour from an image of the threads. If you use multiple data sources, it’s hard to ensure the colours are consistent: the lighting could be different between cameras/scanners and the sampling method could be different. Even differences between software might cause the colour of a single thread to vary from one dataset to another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what mixed data sources looks like, comparing a section from the full manual sample (left) with the mixed sourcing I had initially used:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Purple-side-by-side-mixed-source.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two columns of purple colours going from lightest to darkest in each column&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Left: all manually sampled; Right: mix of DMC conversions and manual samples, with labels for data sources&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The colours pulled from converting Cosmo to DMC were lighter and pinker than the manual samples, so the mixed source sequence looks mottled instead of showing a smooth gradient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sequences where all the colours came from DMC conversion looked a little better, but still came out a little mottled:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Pink-side-by-side-single-sources.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two columns of pink colours going from lightest to darkest in each column&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Left: all manually sampled; Right: all DMC conversions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Fans of Cosmo threads (including the one that lives in my apartment) say that &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecopperfox.blogspot.com/2020/04/lets-talk-about-cosmo-threads.html&quot;&gt;Cosmo threads have nice gradients&lt;/a&gt;. Each colour family has a range of options for slight variations in shade and tone, and this allows you to have very fine control over the colours used in your embroidery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To show the gradients properly in the inventory spreadsheet, I needed a colour dataset that was very precise. If the measurement of each colour varied more than the differences between neighbouring shades, then the gradient effect would be lost. As you can see in the examples above, the gradients look much better (and closer to how they look on the colour card) if you take all the colours from one consistent source.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Variability between data sources is also a challenge for DMC threads, as evidenced by this spreadsheet comparing different DMC colour lists &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/DMC Comparison Spreadsheet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a spreadsheet with columns of DMC colours from different sources&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, lesson learned — make sure to use the same data source for consistency. And if the source you need doesn’t exist, you’ll have to make it yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-2-whats-a-correct-rgb-colour-for-a-real-world-object&quot;&gt;Problem #2: What’s a “correct” RGB colour for a real-world object?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding an “equivalent” digital colour for a real-world object can be quite challenging. You have to contend with the difference between the additive (emitted) colour of computer screens compared to the subtractive (reflected) colour of dyed objects, monitor calibration, the colour spaces used by software, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Archivists deal with some of these problems by using image targets to calibrate their scanning equipment and to assess the colour accuracy of an image. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagescienceassociates.com/mm5/pubs/50Arch07BurnsWilliams.pdf#page=5&quot;&gt;This journal article has an example&lt;/a&gt; on page 5.) To achieve a certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211111200525/http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/FADGI%20Federal%20%20Agencies%20Digital%20Guidelines%20Initiative-2016%20Final_rev1.pdf&quot;&gt;archival standard&lt;/a&gt;, you have to ensure the white balance, colour accuracy, and luminance are within acceptable margins of error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, no-one has scanned a floss colour card to archival standards, and probably won’t any time soon, since the equipment is quite expensive. But I did want to test the perceived colour accuracy of different data sources, so I set up a blind experiment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I randomly selected 20 threads with manually sampled and DMC conversion colours, and created blind pairs of both colour sources:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 350px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Colour-Test-Pairs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pairs of coloured cells with two colour cells for each thread&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once everything was set up, I had Katrina look at each floss colour and mark down which of the two computer colours was the better match. Interestingly enough, neither data source had any huge advantage over the other in providing a more “accurate” match to the real-world object. She picked 13/20 of the manually-sampled colours as the better match, and 7/20 of the colours from DMC conversion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also tried the experiment, and had even more ambivalent results, with a 50:50 split between manual samples and DMC conversion as being the closer match.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing we both noticed while doing the test was that the angle of lighting played a huge role in our perceptions of the physical thread. Cosmo thread is, for lack of a better term, shiny. As you can see from the video below, even minor changes in the angle of lighting affect how light the thread appears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/Videos/cosmo_thread_light_colour_perception.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt; &lt;p&gt;Katrina also noted that people could have different subjective ideas of what makes a good match. One person could prioritize matching the lightness of the physical thread with the computer colour, while another could prioritize matching the hue, even if the lightness was slightly off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous-final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also did some experiments with mathematical calculations of colour distance, which are pretty dull to write about. However, the math of calculating the difference between colours, &lt;em&gt;weighted to human perception&lt;/em&gt;, is kinda neat and you can read about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page on colour difference calculations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re curious about how to sample colours using GIMP, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7oyUekkrVo&quot;&gt;video tutorial on the color picker tool&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of showing the basics. A couple additional tips I would share:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you detach the info window, it looks a lot better and you can move it around. I found it particularly useful to keep the info window next to the part of the image I was sampling to make sure the colour looked right compared to the source.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;By adjusting the “number of columns” option, you can change the palette layout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you click on the swatches added to a palette, you can name them. E.g. in this case you could put the thread number used by the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can export palettes to several different formats. Unfortunately, the “text file” format doesn’t include the names given to each swatch, so you’ll have to use one of the other formats (e.g. CSS stylesheet) if you want the names as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/GIMP-Palette-Options.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagrams of the palette editing and palette export menus in GIMP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Using the palette menus in GIMP&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Final thought — I mentioned archival digitization standards earlier in the post. If you’re interested in this kind of thing, I would glance through the document I had linked above, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211111200525/http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/FADGI%20Federal%20%20Agencies%20Digital%20Guidelines%20Initiative-2016%20Final_rev1.pdf&quot;&gt;2016 Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Cultural Heritage Materials&lt;/a&gt;. It’s incredible how much care goes into digitizing archival objects. It’s much more complicated than just having someone take regular scans of old documents!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;My understanding is that “floss” consists of six strands of thread bundled together, which you can split apart as desired. Throughout the post I’ll use “thread” and “floss” somewhat interchangeably. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;A colour card is to floss what a paint chip fan deck is to paint. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twogreenzebras.com/category/512-cosmo&quot;&gt;this chart from the Two Green Zebras shop&lt;/a&gt; in Australia and converted it into a spreadsheet using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tabula.technology/&quot;&gt;Tabula&lt;/a&gt;. I then got the DMC colours from &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.crazyartzone.com/dmc.asp&quot;&gt;crazyartzone.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;Relaxing Classical&lt;/em&gt; takes the existing “canon” and selects mood-appropriate pieces from within it. Pieces by Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, Debussy, and Rachmaninoff make up nearly half of the playlist. As a result, only two of the tracks featured are by living composers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has 36 tracks by living composers, half of the overall total. This is because &lt;strong&gt;“Classical” in Spotify’s parlance means a mix of mood-appropriate pieces from the “canon” alongside modern artists who make mood music using classical instruments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not just true of mood-themed classical playlists! It’s also true of Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical New Releases&lt;/em&gt; playlist, in part because of how “new releases” playlists play into Spotify’s curatorial approach. Like with Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt; playlist, one of the clearest signifiers of this distinction between the two platforms is the very large number of living composers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;classical-new-releases&quot;&gt;Classical New Releases&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Classical New Releases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;If Average US Orchestra&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Tracks&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;70&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Women&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;5 (7.1%)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;BIPOC&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;6 (8.6%)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Indigenous / Black Women&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;2 (2.9%)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Living&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;39 (55.7%)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;11&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first notable thing about this playlist is that it is the only one to have more people of colour than the “Average US Orchestra” comparison. It also has a very high number of living composers, as noted above.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to the equivalent playlist from Apple Music, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html#the-a-list-classical&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A List: Classical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this playlist has more women (five compared to two), a greater number of people of colour (six compared to two), and two tracks by women of colour (there are none in Apple music’s playlist). Like with the mood-themed playlists, the biggest gap is in living composers: 39 in Spotify’s new releases playlist compared to five in Apple’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, going back to what I said at the top, it’s not an Apple to apples &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; comparison. In contrast to Apple’s &lt;em&gt;A List&lt;/em&gt;, Spotify’s playlist isn’t meant to be a showcase for new recordings of classical music — it’s primarily a feeder playlist for classical-themed mood playlists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ecosystem-supporting----------------------------algorithmic-curation&quot;&gt;The Ecosystem Supporting Algorithmic Curation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you read about how Spotify approaches curation, it becomes clear that they view their playlists as an ecosystem that works hand in hand with the algorithm to surface the most popular and engaging music to listeners. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://playlistradar.com/spotify-101-understanding-the-spotify-playlist-landscape/&quot;&gt;article by Playlist Radar&lt;/a&gt; explains it well:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spotify editors often test out new tracks on smaller “feeder” playlists. Tracks that perform well on a playlist like “New Noise” (289K followers) might be promoted to “Rock This” (4.3M followers); songs that gain traction on a playlist such as “Most Necessary” (1.8M followers) might eventually end up on “Rap Caviar” (10.3M followers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;New release playlists are a good entry point to this system: every week a new batch of songs are tested to see how they perform, and the winners (as determined by the algorithm), make their way onto other official playlists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winning the algorithmic hunger games and getting a song placed on a prominent official playlist is how you make a living on Spotify, and the stakes are high. Just take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/1r7qNZsIrYhszVnFp92pv9?si=ltfVroSuQJqyAuCtxb-EWw&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butterflying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the album by Elena Kats-Chernin that includes &lt;em&gt;Lullaby for Nick&lt;/em&gt;, which we examined in the previous post. &lt;em&gt;Lullaby for Nick&lt;/em&gt; has over 6 million listens &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The next most-played song, &lt;em&gt;Butterflying&lt;/em&gt;, has only 86,000 listens &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Butterflying&lt;/em&gt; is aided slightly by its position as the first song in the album, but nothing compares to the power of official playlists to drive listens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Placement on a prominent official playlist like &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt; probably therefore makes the difference between a song that pays for a very nice dinner out and a song that pays rent for an entire year. With that said, let’s meet some of the contenders for an algorithmic golden ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;deborah-cheetham-christmas-with-you&quot;&gt;Deborah Cheetham: Christmas With You&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Cheetham&quot;&gt;Deborah Joy Cheetham&lt;/a&gt; AO (born 24 November 1964), is an Aboriginal Australian soprano, actor, composer and playwright.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the data for this project was collected around the winter holiday period in 2020, hence the occurrence of this modern Christmas carol and &lt;em&gt;Silent Night&lt;/em&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The carol was commissioned by the classical arm of the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC Classic) and performed by over 1,500 singers whose performances were digitally edited together with music from the Queensland Symphony Orchestra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a song composed in 2020, you could believe it had been part of Christmas traditions for decades. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/classic/read-and-watch/music-reads/deborah-cheetham-christmas-with-you/12821958&quot;&gt;Cheetham writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do not apologise for the nostalgic style of this carol. There is longing, yes, but there is also hope. For me, hope is ultimately the message and meaning of Christmas. Hope is born into this world every day. We have only to grasp it, commit to it, cherish it and renew it. Sounds like a lot to do? Well… that is what music is for. That is why we sing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/classic/read-and-watch/music-reads/deborah-cheetham-christmas-with-you/12821958&quot;&gt;learn more about the project and get the sheet music&lt;/a&gt; on the ABC Classic website.

In 2019, she became the fifth artist to top the BBC’s annual Sound of… poll and win the Rising Star Award at the Brit Awards in the same year. Her debut album Not Your Muse was released in 2021 and debuted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart…. In the same year, Celeste was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing “Hear My Voice” from the film The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here’s the origin story of this track: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5Ck2pBM8zZNIjIxeiEiVvy?si=4fda76f94be74fdf&quot;&gt;original song&lt;/a&gt; was written by Celeste with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrabel&quot;&gt;(Stephen) Wrabel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Hartman&quot;&gt;Jamie Hartman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and it was released in September 2019 as the lead single for her album &lt;em&gt;Not Your Muse&lt;/em&gt;. This version, however, is an instrumental cover arranged by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Bowers&quot;&gt;Kris Bowers&lt;/a&gt; for the first season of the Netflix series &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, and performed by cellist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hillarysmithcello.com/menu&quot;&gt;Hillary Smith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The entire &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack has classical pop covers like this, with many performed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_String_Quartet&quot;&gt;Vitamin String Quartet&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a string cover of Ariana Grande’s &lt;em&gt;thank u, next&lt;/em&gt; is the music for a ballroom dance in episode one. An &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comments:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alongside these classical-pop mashups, &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; serves up classical warhorses like Mozart and Shostakovich…. By bringing modern melodies into the proper world of Regency England, &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that classical music wasn’t always so stuffy and solemn. In its time, it trafficked in the same scandal as modern pop. Just with powdered wigs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this sounds interesting to you, I would highly recommend checking out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://switchedonpop.com/episodes/bridgerton-kris-bowers&quot;&gt;interview with the composer, Kris Bowers&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;em&gt;Switched on Pop&lt;/em&gt; podcast. Bowers also wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/5585/for-a-younger-self-world-premiere&quot;&gt;violin concerto that was premiered by the American Youth Symphony&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t think there’s a full recording of it, but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/american-youth-symphony/for-a-younger-self-excerpt-by-kris-bowers&quot;&gt;listen to an excerpt on the AYS SoundCloud page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;ramin-djawadi-game-of-thrones-theme&quot;&gt;Ramin Djawadi: Game of Thrones Theme&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramin_Djawadi&quot;&gt;Ramin Djawadi&lt;/a&gt; (born 19 July 1974) is a German score composer. He is known for his scores for the 2008 Marvel film Iron Man and the HBO series Game of Thrones, for which he was nominated for Grammy Awards in 2009, 2018 and 2020…. He won two consecutive Emmy Awards for Game of Thrones, in 2018 for the episode “The Dragon and the Wolf” and in 2019 for “The Long Night”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The track featured on the playlist is a cover of the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; theme by the Metamorphose String Orchestra in Belarus. I actually prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/2q6fxAvSpqXR4jx9Ne7RGz?si=4fd1b46a87b3409f&quot;&gt;the original&lt;/a&gt; because it has the big percussion backing, but this version is pretty good too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently Ramin Djawadi did a big &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; with orchestra tour before the pandemic and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toronto.com/events/game-of-thrones/&quot;&gt;came to Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. I’m very sad I missed it; looks like it was a pretty sick show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;masayoshi-fujita-sadness---carlos-cipa-rework&quot;&gt;Masayoshi Fujita: Sadness - Carlos Cipa Rework&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://masayoshifujita.com/about/&quot;&gt;Masayoshi Fujita&lt;/a&gt; is a Japanese vibraphonist, multi-percussionist and composer. Masayoshi first learned how to play the drums, followed by extensive vibraphone training to craft and play his own compositions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Determined not to stick to traditional vibraphone styles or techniques and theory of composition, he seeks his own sound of vibraphone and new possibility of it. [He] also prepares his instrument with strings of bead, strips of foil and similar objects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I suppose in the lo-fi world, “rework” conveys something more chill than “remix”, which implies adding another feature artist, dialing some element of the production up to 11, or both. But this is somewhere in-between a remix and a re-orchestration, so “rework” makes a certain kind of sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5vCtL7CKdORJTfJ23OnJTr?si=f5b4f0d02dd74c9d&quot;&gt;original &lt;em&gt;Sadness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was performed by Fujita on vibraphone. In this version, pianist Carlos Cipa is playing the textural parts, and Fujita comes in with the more melodic components on vibraphone. There are some distortion effects thrown in for good measure, especially at the end, and some truly impressive recording techniques used on Cipa’s piano. The resulting tone is incredibly soft and mellow; in fact, after my original half-listen, I had incorrectly jotted down “marimba” instead of “piano”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m incredibly intrigued by what’s happening at 1:20. There’s some kind of echoing knocking sound and what sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uAkaUShxxc&quot;&gt;bowed vibraphone&lt;/a&gt;. But maybe it’s some other technique, and the echoing knocking sound is the attack? &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Not really sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;astor-piazzolla-invierno-porteño&quot;&gt;Astor Piazzolla: Invierno Porteño&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_Piazzolla&quot;&gt;Astor Pantaleón Piazzolla&lt;/a&gt; (March 11, 1921 – July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed Nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is appearance number two for Piazzolla; his &lt;em&gt;Libertango&lt;/em&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#astor-piazzolla-libertango&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estaciones_Porte%C3%B1as&quot;&gt;“Four Seasons of Buenos Aires” suite&lt;/a&gt; inspired by Antonio Vivaldi’s famous &lt;em&gt;The Four Seasons&lt;/em&gt;, and Invierno is the “Winter” part of Piazzolla’s suite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The track featured on the playlist is a cover of &lt;em&gt;Invierno Porteño&lt;/em&gt; by the Japanese duo of cellist &lt;a href=&quot;https://daimiyata.com/eng/biography&quot;&gt;Dai Miyata&lt;/a&gt; (宮田大) and classical guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuji_Ohagi&quot;&gt;Yasuji Ohagi&lt;/a&gt; (大萩康司). It’s the final track from their album &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3gtXPnwpKsrQ0pltXB6l68?si=Q71ZLRHrSRSDgWkwL6HWog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travelogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which features guitar and cello covers of classical music from European and South American composers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like with the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; theme, I would encourage you to check out the original so you can hear Piazzolla play the bandoneon (which is in the same family of instruments as the accordion). But Miyata and Ohagi’s version is well-done too, with lyrical cello lines and warm guitar accompaniment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;kouhei-morita-low-roar&quot;&gt;Kouhei Morita: Low Roar&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Kohei Morita (森田晃平) is] a scene musician from Kagoshima prefecture. He started playing contrabass and electric bass at the age of 16. In 2010, he moved his base of activities to Tokyo and participated in live performances and recordings of many artists such as VAMPS, Ikimonogakari, little green monster, Anri Kumaki as a bassist. His PRIMITIVE ART ORCHESTRA, which has been active since 2012, has released his three original albums. He is also active as a composer and arranger…. He is active with an emphasis on warm and unsophisticated bass tones, nostalgic tunes with scenes, and emotional and romantic arrangements. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/7LdO9fKTNWQ6C52N1gcwo8?si=CNMrG6MRSVuZ-ldneTXJ7Q&quot;&gt;森田晃平 Spotify Artist Bio&lt;/a&gt;, via Google Translate)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like the use of glissando &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; here; it really evokes a feeling that the double bass is singing. One neat effect of streaming is that it does remove a lot of the barriers to reaching a global audience. I don’t think there’s any English media about Morita, so how else would someone from Canada discover a double bass player in Japan? Very cool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;hania-rani-silent-night&quot;&gt;Hania Rani: Silent Night&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hania_Rani&quot;&gt;Hania Rani&lt;/a&gt; (born Hanna Raniszewska; 1990, Gdańsk) is a Polish pianist, composer and singer. She studied music at the Music School Feliks Nowowiejski in Gdańsk and the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music. (Also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://haniarani.com/about/&quot;&gt;Bio on Hania Rani Website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, this is essentially &lt;em&gt;Silent Night&lt;/em&gt;, deconstructed. Part of a rich tradition in classical music of taking a tune, pulling it apart, making variations, and putting it back together again as a bigger or different whole. Another good example from earlier would be Coleridge-Taylor’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#samuel-coleridge-taylor-symphonic-variations-on-an-african-air-op63&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Symphonic Variations on an African Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If stores are going to insist on playing holiday songs as soon as November rolls around (even the local falafel shop was playing christmas music already the other night), this kind of track is probably the way to go. It evokes the holidays without being so strong a flavour that your average retail worker would be losing their mind the tenth time it’s played &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;martina-stock-see-the-face&quot;&gt;Martina Stock: See The Face&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Martina Stock] plays her black concert harp not in the “classical way“ - contemporary, combining acoustic melodies with electronic surfaces and a loop station…. In addition to this, she has developed a lighting system, which makes her possible, an unique play in the dark [sic].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;…Martina Stock grew up in Bischofshofen, in the mountains of Salzburg countryside, Austria. She studied at the University Mozarteum Salzburg which she completed in 2009. She lives and works in Berlin and Salzburg. (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/6kv6jaS62CE2oWnH7msKzT&quot;&gt;Martina Stock Spotify Artist Bio&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like the circular structure of this one: it begins and ends with a fanfare-like theme, with a long series of variations in the middle that are constantly moving and evolving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Martina Stock is also a visual artist, and does a lot of silkscreen pieces (i.e. serigraphy). In some of her shows she combines her visual and musical talents, surrounding herself in her silkscreen works and adding lighting effects to the space and to her harp. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNK9ZJ6XGDY&quot;&gt;one example, titled &lt;em&gt;The Blue Eros&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;james-morgan--juliette-pochin-veni-creator-spiritus---chill-mix&quot;&gt;James Morgan &amp;amp; Juliette Pochin: Veni Creator Spiritus - Chill Mix&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morganpochin.com/63/Morgan-Pochin&quot;&gt;James Morgan and Juliette Pochin&lt;/a&gt; formed their partnership Morgan Pochin whilst undergraduates at Cambridge, and have gone on to work in a huge variety of fields, from EMMY award winning TV series to UK album chart successes, feature films and compositions for the concert platform and stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, so “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni_Creator_Spiritus&quot;&gt;a hymn&lt;/a&gt;, but for spa days” is actually not a bad idea! Choral music can be very relaxing and beautiful, and the addition of soft synths is well done here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the claps… I can’t get over the claps. This song would have been fine if they hadn’t scrolled over to the percussion section of their keyboard, picked the fakest-sounding clap, and then applied reverb to it. Why???&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kind of a weird way to end, but there it is. Good idea, hate the claps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;up-next&quot;&gt;Up Next&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the end of the deep dives, but probably not the last post on the topic of classical streaming playlists. There are a number of interesting things I came across relating to the streaming platforms themselves, ranging from the UK parliament study mentioned in the previous post to the oddly-anonymous streaming artists that featured on several of the Spotify playlists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also have two other data sets that could be analyzed. The first one is longitudinal: I’ve been saving a weekly copy of the track listings for the Spotify playlists examined in this series to see how they evolve over time. I have a similar dataset for Apple Music, but it only covers a couple months &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second dataset includes playlists and track listings from Primephonic, the classical streaming service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic/&quot;&gt;acquired by Apple in late August&lt;/a&gt;. From a glance, I don’t think the representation of composers on Primephonic is going to be notably different than on Apple Music’s existing playlists, but it’ll be interesting to look through regardless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before digging into all that, I might take a break and write about other things. I’ve been wanting to write about &lt;a href=&quot;https://donne-uk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Equality-Diversity-in-Concert-Halls_2020_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;DONNE’s 2021 study of repertoire by 100 orchestras&lt;/a&gt; worldwide for a while. There are also some interesting visualizations I can make from the 2019/20 Institute for Composer Diversity analysis using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/programming/2021/07/03/building-orchestra-season-visualization-tool.html&quot;&gt;tool I created earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or maybe I’ll write about something else entirely! I have an interesting idea for a post about geographic data analysis for nonprofit impact measurement. We’ll see…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;playlist-methodology-and-data&quot;&gt;Playlist, Methodology, and Data&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can listen to all of the pieces featured in this playlist analysis series here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6vQwkvRqWbGEF5IKZmC6na?si=1829c2da26b84f03&quot;&gt;Spotify: Classical Deep Dive - Spotify &amp;amp; Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Full methodology notes for all my music posts can be found via the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/&quot;&gt;Main Methodology Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Details and data for the streaming service playlists analysis can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/streaming-service-demographic-analysis.html&quot;&gt;Streaming Analysis Methodology Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More details about how I used the data from the Institute for Composer Diversity to create the comparison to US orchestra mainstage seasons can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/ICD-orchestra-season-analysis.html&quot;&gt;ICD 2019/20 Season Analysis Methodology Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was going to do a sort of “ba-dum tsssh” here with emoji, but it turns out there’s no cymbal emoji, so this is not possible.

Pulling a bow across a violin string, for example, would actually have three components: the attack of the bow starting to move (if you’re up close, it sounds a bit crunchy), the “sustain” of the string resonating as the bow continues to move, and then a soft “decay” as the string keeps ringing after the bow has been lifted. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;A fancy Italian music term for a note that slides from one pitch to another. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:7&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;My personal tolerance level is that I think I could listen to Mariah Carey’s &lt;em&gt;All I Want for Christmas Is You&lt;/em&gt; maybe about three times before starting to feel irate; on the other hand, I’m not actually sure I have a limit for Wham!’s &lt;em&gt;Last Christmas&lt;/em&gt;.

Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;Relaxing Classical&lt;/em&gt; takes the existing “canon” and selects mood-appropriate pieces from within it. Pieces by Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, Debussy, and Rachmaninoff make up nearly half of the playlist. As a result, only two of the tracks featured are by living composers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has 36 tracks by living composers, half of the overall total. This is because “Classical” in Spotify’s parlance means a mix of mood-appropriate pieces from the “canon” alongside modern artists who make mood music using classical instruments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The living composers responsible for those 36 tracks range from often-anonymous artists, &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; whose entire career is designed around providing the kind of algorithmically-friendly music favoured by mood playlists, to artists like Elena Kats-Chernin, who frequently work with orchestras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;alexis-ffrench-together-at-last-bluebird&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench: Together At Last; Bluebird&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ffrench&quot;&gt;Alexis Ffrench&lt;/a&gt; (born 1970) is a British classical soul pioneer, composer, producer and pianist. Not only is Ffrench the UK’s biggest selling pianist of 2020, he has headlined London’s Royal Albert Hall, collaborated with fashion houses Miyake and Hugo Boss, played Latitude Festival, worked with Paloma Faith, composed several film scores and shares the same management team as Little Mix and Niall Horan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Appearance #2 for Ffrench, whose &lt;em&gt;A Time for Giving&lt;/em&gt; was featured on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/03/01/deep-dive-apple-music.html#alexis-ffrench-a-time-for-giving&quot;&gt;Apple Music’s &lt;em&gt;The A-List: Classical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The first of these two songs, &lt;em&gt;Together At Last&lt;/em&gt;, is the titular song from Ffrench’s 2018 holiday EP. Like &lt;em&gt;A Time for Giving&lt;/em&gt;, which is from Ffrench’s 2020 holiday EP, &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;, it reminds me of the church music influences that Ffrench has spoken about in his music.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second, &lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt;, is far and away Ffrench’s most popular song, and in my comments about the Apple Music playlist, I linked to a great performance of it from the BRIT awards. It reminds me in so many good ways of &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; from Michael Giacchino’s soundtrack to &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; — the sighing phrases, the gentle piano, the sense of time looping and passing at the same time. It’s really excellent. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;amy-beach-berceuse-lullaby-no-2-from-three-compositions-op-40&quot;&gt;Amy Beach: Berceuse (Lullaby), No. 2 from Three Compositions, Op. 40&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Beach&quot;&gt;Amy Marcy Cheney Beach&lt;/a&gt; (September 5, 1867 – December 27, 1944) was an American composer and pianist. She was the first successful American female composer of large-scale art music. Her “Gaelic” Symphony, premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. She was one of the first American composers to succeed without the benefit of European training, and one of the most respected and acclaimed American composers of her era. As a pianist, she was acclaimed for concerts she gave featuring her own music in the United States and in Germany.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another second appearance: Beach’s &lt;em&gt;Young Birches, Op. 128&lt;/em&gt; were featured on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#amy-beach-young-birches-op-128-no-2&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The song title doesn’t really make it clear (the track in the playlist is from a lullaby compilation album), but this is the second movement from a trio, which you can listen to on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/24nOyX4MeANGSsKhYclqDa?si=Ekwz695wRRGbpme2rf2j6w&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;album from the Klugherz-Timmons Duo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;nadje-noordhuis-bluebird&quot;&gt;Nadje Noordhuis: Bluebird&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Described as “one of the most compelling voices to emerge on her instrument in recent years” (Dan Bilawksy, All about Jazz), Australian-born New York based trumpeter/composer Nadje Noordhuis possesses one of the most unforgettably lyrical voices in modern music. Her deeply-felt, clarion tone and evocative compositional gift meld classical rigor, jazz expression, and world music accents into a sound that is distinctively her own. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nadjenoordhuis.com/about-1&quot;&gt;Personal Website Biography&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our second song called &lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt; on this playlist. One interesting thing they both have in common is that the piano is mic’d in such a way that you can hear the sounds of the sustain pedal and other moving parts click and thud in the background. It’s an interesting feature of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://switchedonpop.com/episodes/why-lo-fi-is-the-perfect-background-music&quot;&gt;lo-fi production&lt;/a&gt; you can find on many mood-themed playlists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, the real jewel of this track is the trumpet performance. Noordhuis plays with a lovely warm tone and is able to effortlessly glide into and out of silence in certain phrases. If you like this track, I’d recommend you check out the whole album, which is titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/7k6LMeVKzWrL9XHzNTPkXu?si=9RwJMxm6Sa-pDQ6A-w4nGQ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten Sails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-digression-about-metadata&quot;&gt;A Digression About Metadata&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing about this song is that it illustrates an issue that has been frequently discussed about Spotify and other streaming platforms. At a high level, a song has two sets of rights, which result in two types of revenue streams. First, there is the “master” right to the recording itself, and second, there are the “publishing” rights for the music composition. When you stream a track on Apple Music or Spotify, both sets of rightsholders need to be paid. However, especially for publishing rightsholders (e.g. a composer or songwriter), the data that tells the streaming service who to pay is often missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; problem. In a recent review, the UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee heard that there are billions of dollars unallocated due to bad data:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;At best, mismatched, incomplete or missing metadata can result in delays to creator royalties for months or even years. At worst, this can result in payments being misallocated or otherwise consigned as unclaimed or non-attributable royalties to ‘black boxes’. Black boxes consisted of $2.5 billion in unallocated income in 2019 alone. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, artists are able to get the data fixed and collect the income they are entitled to. However, the committee heard that most of the money goes elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a period of time, black boxes are then assigned pro-rata to streams that have been correctly identified, which is established in standard publishing agreements. This means that those creators and companies, particularly who are most listened to, are effectively are [sic] paid twice: first for their own streams, and then for streams that cannot be allocated. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons this problem persists, including the need to digitize paper records for back catalogues, and limitations on who can submit corrections or challenges to bad data. However, a big part of the problem is lack of effort from record labels:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because the recording and song rights are licensed separately and often held by different music creators and companies, many labels do not supply the relevant ISWC &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when licensing music to streaming services, meaning that songwriters often lose out altogether when music is streamed. Often, this is by choice because of the difficulty of doing so: in oral evidence, Maria Forte asserted that in conversation with one record label, a representative said “‘I don’t care about composer information because it’s nothing to do with me. I’m not changing my system to do that’”. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In essence, there is a mismatch of responsibility and incentive. The record label earns its income from owning the master rights to a song. However, it is responsible for supplying the data that identifies the master rights holder(s) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the publishing rights holder(s) when the song is uploaded. As a result, the master rights data is usually correct, but the publishing rights data is often incorrect or omitted, unless the record label has a financial stake in ensuring the publishing rights data is correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent example of this — when the song was originally uploaded to Spotify, the songwriter credit for Nadje Noordhuis was missing:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Screen Shot 2021-09-18 at 4.30.30 PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Spotify &amp;quot;Show Credits&amp;quot; dialog box. &amp;quot;Written by&amp;quot; is blank.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, at the time, songwriter credits for Nadje’s collaborator, Luke Howard, &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; included on the same album. The label, Lukktone, appears to be owned or controlled by Luke Howard (since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discogs.com/label/792716-Lukktone&quot;&gt;all of its releases feature him as an artist&lt;/a&gt;). I’m not accusing anyone here of malice — it just illustrates the broader issue: Lukktone had a strong financial incentive to ensure that the songwriter credits for Luke Howard were correctly submitted; it had less of an incentive to ensure that the credits for Nadje Noordhuis were also correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this particular story has a positive ending. At some point between September and October 2021, the credits were corrected:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Images/Screen Shot 2021-10-31 at 12.17.23 PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Spotify &amp;quot;Show Credits&amp;quot; dialog box. &amp;quot;Written by&amp;quot; lists &amp;quot;Nadje Noordhuis-Fairfax&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even still, this album was released in 2015, which means that at best, Nadja Noordhuis will be receiving a couple thousand dollars in publishing revenue &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for a song that’s been streamed over 4 million times on Spotify — six years late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in reading more about this issue, you can check out a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18531476/music-industry-song-royalties-metadata-credit-problems&quot;&gt;article from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from a couple years ago as well as the full discussion of the issue in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6739/documents/72525/default/&quot;&gt;UK Parliament Report&lt;/a&gt; (starting on the page numbered 49/page 53 in the PDF).

I’m about to tell you a long story, starting from the beginning.” Perhaps I should have suggested you listen to this before the metadata digression above.

The methodology page also has notes on &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/streaming-service-demographic-analysis.html#unknown-composers&quot;&gt;how unknown artists were handled in the analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make sure, I went to listen to &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; again, and this has tangentially inspired me with a business idea for orchestras:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone who has seen &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; will be unable to listen to &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; without being brought to tears, or at least this is my personal experience. It’s a masterpiece of modern cinema, packing an incredible amount of emotional affect into a very short number of minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, the last time I went to see a Pops program about film scores, &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; was not on it, which is surely a crime, but also an incredible missed opportunity. Much like you can shore up a financially deficient theme park in &lt;em&gt;Rollercoaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt; by jacking up the price of umbrellas when it rains, every orchestra should put &lt;em&gt;Married Life&lt;/em&gt; just before intermission and then have the ushers sell packets of tissues for $5 each on the way out to the lobby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, OK, so in the current context of there still very much being a global pandemic, maybe encouraging everyone to nose trumpet for revenue is a bad idea health-wise. But when COVID-19 is finally over and dead in the ground (dear lord, one day soon I hope), this is the path back to financial stability that all orchestras should surely take.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, my point is that &lt;em&gt;Bluebird&lt;/em&gt; is a really good song. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 93, page 51.

In a sense, this should be the most comparable playlist to the average US orchestra season since it only focuses on orchestral repertoire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#classical-essentials&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this playlist has significantly fewer composers who are women or people of colour compared to the average US orchestra season, and no women of colour composers at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;heitor-villa-lobos-choros-no-8&quot;&gt;Heitor Villa-Lobos: Choros No. 8&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heitor_Villa-Lobos&quot;&gt;Heitor Villa-Lobos&lt;/a&gt; (March 5, 1887 – November 17, 1959) was a Brazilian composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist described as “the single most significant creative figure in 20th-century Brazilian art music”. Villa-Lobos has become the best-known South American composer of all time. A prolific composer, he wrote numerous orchestral, chamber, instrumental and vocal works, totaling over 2000 works by his death in 1959.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is part of a larger series of pieces named after chôro, “music played by an ensemble of Brazilian street musicians (called chorões) using both African and European instruments, who improvise in a free and often dissonant kind of counterpoint called contracanto.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I’m quite fond of the fact that the beginning sounds a bit like the warm-up that happens onstage before most concerts start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems that Villa-Lobos is played much less often by US orchestras now than during his late lifetime. In his 1951 book “The American Symphony Orchestra: A Social History of Musical Taste”, John H. Mueller wrote “Among the composers [of Latin America], Villa-Lobos of Brazil is the most noted and enjoys a statistically perceptible rank in the repertoire.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanorchestras.org/learn/artistic-planning/orchestra-repertoire-report/&quot;&gt;League of American Orchestras Repertoire Reports&lt;/a&gt; note only two programs featuring pieces by Villa-Lobos in 2012/13 and no programs in 2011/12. The Institute for Composer Diversity analysis from 2019/20 (which included slightly more than twice as many orchestras compared to the League reports) notes eight performances of pieces by Villa-Lobos. The only major symphony featured in either source was Oregon, who included Villa-Lobos’ &lt;em&gt;Uirapurú&lt;/em&gt; in their 2019/20 season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the explanation may be related to US foreign policy? It’s possible that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Neighbor_policy&quot;&gt;Good Neighbour Policy&lt;/a&gt; espoused by President Roosevelt contributed to interest in South American composers; in turn, after the fall of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas in 1945, Villa-Lobos was able to travel again, and his Wikipedia page notes that he “made regular visits to the United States”. If I can find an analysis of US orchestral repertoire that follows on from the time period of Mueller’s book, it would be interesting to see if there was a decline in performances of Villa-Lobos’ work brought on by a return to more interventionist South American US foreign policy with the onset of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One other fun comment on Villa-Lobos from Mueller’s book: in a section about audience reactions, he writes about how the tastes of conductor Leopold Stokowski were sometimes at odds with those of his audience. A Schoenberg performance apparently elicited a “shower of forthright hisses” from the audience, after which Stokowski “turned to his audience and defensively pleaded freedom of expression for the artist.” Mueller then tactfully notes that “Those who agreed with him applauded; those who preferred freedom of expression for the audience made known their opinions by a contrary sign.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stokowski later performed this piece—Chorôs No. 8—resulting in a similar audience reaction. Presumably having learned that arguing with the audience did no good, “on this occasion [Stokowski] invited the disaffected members of the audience to leave “and smoke the classic cigarette.”” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Final note: I recently discovered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3jvrf0brPEohaxmFHffZGM?si=YbyASROJTk6RiGjFaDCvyQ&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;album of Villa-Lobos Choral Transcriptions&lt;/a&gt; performed by the São Paulo Symphony Choir and Valentina Peleggi and really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend you give it a listen!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;toru-takemitsu-a-flock-descends-into-the-pentagonal-garden&quot;&gt;Toru Takemitsu: A Flock Descends Into the Pentagonal Garden&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dru_Takemitsu&quot;&gt;Tōru Takemitsu&lt;/a&gt; (武満 徹, Takemitsu Tōru, October 8, 1930 – February 20, 1996) was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu was admired for the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is known for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy and for fusing sound with silence and tradition with innovation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know, I’ve listened to this one several times, and I don’t think I like it; it’s too abstract for my tastes. It seems to be one of Takemitsu’s more well-known pieces for Orchestra, and one of the ones I had heard of already before doing this project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do like this style of music, then let me shill for my employer and recommend you check out an &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3BFaA08GIWtZlfKdUxDIHu?si=2jf4L9brS7-fKsUKxDFZ7w&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;album of four of Takemitsu’s early orchestra pieces&lt;/a&gt; from 1969, with the TSO conducted by then-Music Director Seiji Ozawa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;louise-farrenc-symphony-no-3-in-g-minor-op-36-i-adagio---allegro&quot;&gt;Louise Farrenc: Symphony No. 3 in G Minor, Op. 36: I. Adagio - Allegro&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Farrenc&quot;&gt;Louise Farrenc&lt;/a&gt; (née Jeanne-Louise Dumont; 31 May 1804 – 15 September 1875) was a French composer, virtuoso pianist and teacher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the second piece we’ve looked at by Farrenc; the third movement from her Nonet in E-Flat Major, Op. 38 was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tallcoleman.me/music/2021/05/03/deep-dive-spotify-part-one.html#louise-farrenc-nonet-in-e-flat-major-op-38-iii-scherzo-vivace&quot;&gt;Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;Classical Essentials&lt;/em&gt; playlist&lt;/a&gt;. This symphony was written two years earlier than the Nonet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By self-admission, Farrenc’s Symphony No. 3 is the only symphony by a female composer on Tom Service’s 2014 Guardian series on “50 Greatest Symphonies”. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jun/24/symphony-guide-louise-farrenc-third-symphony-tom-service&quot;&gt;Service’s article on Farrenc’s symphony&lt;/a&gt;, he says the final movement is his favourite. I think mine is the first — the boisterous theme that comes after the slow lead-in is a top-tier example of “big C” classical drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-commercial-recordings&quot;&gt;The Role of Commercial Recordings&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his article, Service noted that there were only two commercial recordings of Farrenc’s Symphony No. 3: one from the North German Radio Philharmonic (the one featured on this playlist) and another from the Orchestre de Bretagne. Two more recordings have since been made by the Solistes Européens, Luxembourg in 2018 &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and very recently by the Insula Orchestra in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to watch how the availability of commercial recordings has started to catch up with changes in orchestra programming to feature more diverse composers. For example, Florence Price became a household name for many orchestras in 2020/21, while at the same time only her first symphony had more than one recording. Now, as of September 24, Deutche Grammophon is releasing a recording of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.umusic.ca/press-releases/yannick-nezet-seguin-the-philadelphia-orchestra-announce-new-album-florence-price-symphonies-nos-1-3/&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Orchestra playing symphonies 1 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. There’s still only the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2EKqIZNOAbDdk4F1gL56Wh?si=65OzboWRSyiCotqOY3pANQ&amp;amp;dl_branch=1&quot;&gt;recording of Symphony No. 4 by the Fort Smith Symphony&lt;/a&gt;, but hopefully more are on their way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are still some gaps to fill: earlier in the year I did some back-of-the-napkin math, and about one-third of the most-played orchestra pieces by women composers have no commercial recordings at all; most notably Missy Mazzoli’s &lt;em&gt;Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres)&lt;/em&gt;, although you can find some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyJt0aSnP8&quot;&gt;recorded performances of it on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe this is a small part of the puzzle — even if you had curators at Spotify and Apple Music whose programming choices were more in line with the average US orchestra, there are still a sizeable number of pieces that aren’t in the catalogue yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;kaija-saariaho-du-cristal&quot;&gt;Kaija Saariaho: Du Cristal&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaija_Saariaho&quot;&gt;Kaija Anneli Saariaho&lt;/a&gt; (Finnish: [ˈkɑi̯jɑ ˈsɑːriɑho]; née Laakkonen; born 14 October 1952) is a Finnish composer based in Paris, France. … In a 2019 composers’ poll by BBC Music Magazine, Saariaho was ranked the greatest living composer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saariaho studied composition in Helsinki, Freiburg, and Paris, where she has lived since 1982. Her research at the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music (IRCAM) marked a turning point in her music away from strict serialism towards spectralism. Her characteristically rich, polyphonic textures are often created by combining live music and electronics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like “A Flock Descends…” this one is also a bit abstract for my tastes, though I find myself liking it more, and I would definitely be interested in hearing it live. In particular, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://saariaho.org/works/du-cristal/&quot;&gt;description on Saariaho’s website&lt;/a&gt; mentions that the piece has “an important part for synthesizer” which isn’t immediately obvious to me; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; maybe being able to see the synth player press the keys would be a good clue as to which sounds are analogue and which are digital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The piece is actually a two-parter of sorts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://saariaho.org/works/a-la-fumee/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;…à la Fumée&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is meant to follow, though it’s clear that Saariaho thinks that each can stand alone, and in fact they were each commissioned for two different orchestras. Like with &lt;em&gt;Du Cristal&lt;/em&gt;, there’s an electronic element to &lt;em&gt;à la Fumée&lt;/em&gt;, with electronically modified alto flute and cello soloists. There were a couple moments where the solo instruments sounded like they were using an effect or filter, but like with &lt;em&gt;Du Cristal&lt;/em&gt;, it’s very subtle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the difference in how I feel about this piece compared to “A Flock Descends…” is that despite both being abstract (by which I mean neither has any clear melody), &lt;em&gt;Du Cristal&lt;/em&gt; feels like it has a clearer structure created by the differences in intensity and instrumentation, whereas I don’t think the musical ideas in “A Flock Descends…” come together in a way that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. I will admit, in both cases, I like each piece a little more after every repeat listen, so who knows, maybe after two dozen plays, I’ll change my mind and think “A Flock Descends…” is great.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;up-next&quot;&gt;Up Next&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because I’m increasingly adding long digressions to these deep dives, it seems like I’m going to have to get through the rest of the Spotify tracks one playlist at a time. Up next is &lt;em&gt;Classical Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, where there are some interesting connections to wider conversations about streaming platforms, including metadata and how artists get paid, and the whole universe of streaming-first artists fostered by Spotify. In-between the digressions, there will also be interesting music to listen to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;playlist-methodology-and-data&quot;&gt;Playlist, Methodology, and Data&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can listen to all of the pieces featured in this playlist analysis series here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6vQwkvRqWbGEF5IKZmC6na?si=1829c2da26b84f03&quot;&gt;Spotify: Classical Deep Dive - Spotify &amp;amp; Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Full methodology notes for all my music posts can be found via the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/&quot;&gt;Main Methodology Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Details and data for the streaming service playlists analysis can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/streaming-service-demographic-analysis.html&quot;&gt;Streaming Analysis Methodology Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More details about how I used the data from the Institute for Composer Diversity to create the comparison to US orchestra mainstage seasons can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/exploring-orchestral-music-methodology/ICD-orchestra-season-analysis.html&quot;&gt;ICD 2019/20 Season Analysis Methodology Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B4ros&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chôros&lt;/em&gt; on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Page 265. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Page 359 of &lt;em&gt;The American Symphony Orchestra: A Social History of Musical Taste&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;From their bio, it seems like the Solistes Européens, Luxembourg claim to be the NBA all star team of European orchestras, but maybe that’s just marketing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I were to guess, I think you can hear it around 11:00? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Coleman</name></author><category term="Music"/><summary type="html">Diving Deeper into Spotify</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Ben-By-High-Park-Pond-Birdwatching.JPG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry></feed>
