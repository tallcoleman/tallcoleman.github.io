<h2 id="birds-in-the-city-a-rough-and-tumble-life">Birds in the City: A Rough-and-Tumble Life</h2>

<p>Toronto is a migratory bird hotspot: we are visited by birds flying
north in the spring (and south again in the fall) from both the Atlantic
and Mississippi flyways. Like many human Torontonians, migrating birds
love our high-quality lakefront properties, including the lush Toronto
Island and bustling Tommy Thompson Park.</p>

<p>Sadly, migratory birds get confused, injured, and killed by two things
found in abundance in downtown Toronto—artificial light and glass.
Problems with birds and glass are well-known: unlike us, birds don’t
understand that what they see in a window is a reflection. As a result,
thousands fly into city windows thinking that a reflected surface is a
restful tree or open sky. At high speed, the collision is usually fatal.
The <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=c5f20621f3161410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f6ce5d0a02148410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">City of Toronto’s best practices guide for bird-friendly
glass</a>
cites a study that estimated that in Canada, about 25 million birds die
each year from colliding with windows. It is a huge and pressing
problem.</p>

<p>Less well-known are the problems caused by artificial light. Many
migratory birds fly at night when it is cooler and safer from predators,
using the moon and stars for navigation. Light coming from our cities
confuses and attracts these birds, drawing them into the city where they
are at risk of being harmed by busy roads or reflective surfaces. This
phenomena is called “Fatal Light Attraction.”</p>

<p>One group trying to solve these problems is <a href="http://www.flap.org/index.php">Fatal Light Awareness
Program (FLAP) Canada</a>. This
Toronto-based group and its volunteers run an emergency bird rescue
program out of Metro Hall at 55 John Street. They also educate
Torontonians about the dangers faced by migratory birds and advocate for
policies and architecture that helps to protect them. While rescuing
birds, they also collect data about when and where different species of
birds are killed to emphasize the importance of taking action. There are
20 types of birds listed under the <em>Species at Risk Act</em> on their record
of species that have been found dead after colliding with glass.</p>

<h2 id="city-planning-to-reduce-bird-deaths">City Planning to Reduce Bird Deaths</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=f85552cc66061410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">Toronto Green
Standard</a>
is a checklist for developers that helps to create more sustainable
buildings. It has two tiers, and a variety of measures that can be
implemented, ranging from improvements to energy efficiency to
protections for migrating birds.</p>

<p>The first tier is mandatory for new developments. Among many other
requirements, it specifies that new buildings must treat at least 85% of
all exterior glass within the first 12 meters of a building in a way
that prevents confusing reflections. This can be done using materials
that are low-reflecting and opaque, or visual markers such as
“fritting”—the application of ceramic dots to the glass during
manufacturing. You can see these methods being used in planned
developments in Bloor-Yorkville:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Images/75 Yorkville Plan-COLLAGE-annotated.jpg" alt="Development proposals in Bloor-Yorkville with bird-friendly
glass" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Development proposals in Bloor-Yorkville with bird-friendly
glass marked in green: Top – 75 Yorkville Ave, Bottom – 848 Yonge
Street.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second tier of the Toronto Green Standard is optional, but the City
offers financial incentives for developers who meet this higher level of
sustainability. Bird protection measures in this tier include a
requirement to point architectural illumination downwards and turn it
off completely between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. during the migratory season so
that the light does not confuse migrating birds. There is also an option
to increase the coverage of bird-friendly glass to 95% of the building’s
first 12 meters. So far, tier two buildings are rare (the City’s website
lists about 10), but hopefully one will be planned for Bloor-Yorkville
soon.</p>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How You Can Help:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Turn off unnecessary lights at home and at work – especially when
you are leaving work at the end of the day. (A timer plug extension
might help).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the outside of your building, place visual markers on
window-glass (5 cm apart) or hang ribbons or strings in front of
windows (10 cm apart). (See <a href="http://www.flap.org/commercial_new.php">FLAP’s tips on
window-markers</a>—the small
details do matter.) It’s OK to be a little creative with window
markers: the Pan-Am aquatic center has small graphics of athletes
instead of dots and it complements their overall branding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speak with your property manager about using lights that turn off
automatically and installing special film outside of windows to
reduce reflection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Place bird feeders close to your windows (less than half a metre
away) so birds leaving the feeder cannot hit your window at high
speed if they go in the wrong direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.flap.org/volunteer.php">Volunteer with FLAP Canada</a> to
help with bird rescue and research.</p>

<h2 id="strategies-that-dont-work">Strategies That <em>Don’t</em> Work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Predator Bird Decals: Many people think that large stickers of
birds-of-prey will scare off smaller birds from windows, but
experiments have shown that it doesn’t work! Smaller markers that
are close together, such as dot stickers 5 cm apart, work much
better.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/Images/IMG_1648-COLLAGE.jpg" alt="Picture of Two types of decals: small dot markers about 5cm
apart and bird-of-prey decals, which are ineffective" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two types of decals: Left – small dot markers about 5cm
apart. Right – bird-of-prey decals, which are ineffective.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Angled Glass: The updated City of Toronto Bird-Friendly Guidelines
has removed angled glass as a strategy due to a lack of supporting
scientific evidence. Birds fly in all directions, so it makes sense
that this would not reduce the impact of collisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interior Blinds: Markers never disappear, and they sit on the
outside of a window. Blinds are designed to be taken up and down,
and sit behind the glass. To be effective, window applications or
coverings need to be on the outside so they block or obscure any
confusing reflections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tinted Glass: Like angled glass, there isn’t enough evidence to say
that tinted glass helps reduce collisions. There are anti-reflective
applications listed in the Toronto Green Standard that will work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interior Screens: Like blinds, these sit behind the glass. There is
a lack of evidence that putting interior screens behind windows will
help prevent birds from colliding with the glass.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-find-a-dead-or-injured-bird">What to Do If You Find a Dead or Injured Bird:</h2>

<p>If you see a bird knocked out from colliding with a window or if you
find an injured bird on the ground, this is what you should do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Try to handle the bird as little as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gently place the bird in an un-waxed paper bag or cardboard box.
Keep the container closed (you can poke some air holes in the top).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do not</strong> give the bird water or food.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Roll clean tissues or paper towel into a donut shape and put it in
the container as a perch for the bird to sit upright.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Temporarily keep the bag or box in a safe, quiet location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you hear the bird fluttering inside the container within an hour,
take it to a park, ravine, or any other area away from hazards, such
as windows, buildings, or busy roads, and slowly open the container
to let the bird fly out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact the <a href="https://www.torontowildlifecentre.com/">Toronto Wildlife
Centre</a> for more
instructions if the bird has not shown any activity after one hour.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
