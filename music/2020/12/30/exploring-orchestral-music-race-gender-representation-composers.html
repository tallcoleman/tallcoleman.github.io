    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In thinking about creative ways that people can explore orchestral music and find new pieces that they like, I’ve been thinking a lot about representation. There are many good pieces written by composers who don’t fit the stereotype of dead white men, and I want to make sure they are prominently featured in my posts.</p>

<p>In some cases, this means exploring the work of living composers, since opportunities for women composers and composers of colour are marginally better now than in previous centuries. In other cases, it means exploring composers from history who are recently being “rediscovered”. Sometimes the rediscovery is literal, as in the case of Florence Price’s fourth symphony, written in 1945, where the manuscript was found in 2009 during a renovation of what used to be her summer home <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Other times, the rediscovery is more of a re-examination, such as appreciating Clara Schumann as a talented composer and performer in her own right, and not just a footnote to her husband’s legacy <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Thinking about race and gender representation is an interesting way to look at music, but it also leads us into other interesting trains of thought. Exploring new music naturally leads us to thinking about the curators—visible and invisible—that select music, promote it, and make it easy to find. It’s also an interesting way to think about the tension between honouring the past and pushing for the future; to what extent orchestras should spend their time acting as a living museum versus playing the work of artists on the vanguard.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I hope that highlighting diverse composers for people who want to get into orchestral music helps to cement change. Familiarity is essential to enjoyment and mass appeal, as noted in the 2019 book <em>Rockonomics</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[T]here is a tendency for music that is popular in our networks to become more appealing to us. And bandwagon effects are further reinforced by the well-established psychological tendency for people to grow to like a particular song the more they hear it.” <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully, the more that people discover, listen to, and enjoy the work of composers who are people of colour, women, or both, the more that these composers will be given their rightful stature in the “canon” of orchestral music.</p>

<h2 id="research-on-composer-representation-in-orchestra-seasons">Research on composer representation in orchestra seasons</h2>

<p>In addition to some of my own research, I have been looking at existing research that has been done on the representation of composers within orchestra seasons (primarily for orchestras in the United States). I’ve included a list at the <a href="#appendix-analyses-of-orchestra-seasons">end of this post</a> as an appendix.</p>

<p>Most of these analyses highlight the lack of women composers, composers of colour, or both, who are programmed in orchestra seasons. The good news is that some progress is being made — for example, among the biggest US orchestras, representation of women composers has more than tripled in the last five years (more on this later). However, there is still a long way to go — the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210530071525/https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons">2019/20 season analysis of 120 US orchestras from the Institute for Composer Diversity</a> found that only 8% of works performed were by women composers, and only 6% were by composers from underrepresented racial, ethnic, or cultural heritages.</p>

<h2 id="not-just-who-also-how">Not just <em>who</em>: also <em>how</em></h2>

<p>To complement the quantitative information from the various season analyses mentioned above, I want to introduce two other interesting ways to dig deeper into how composers are represented in orchestra programs:</p>

<h3 id="duration-and-placement">Duration and placement</h3>

<p>The most common format for an orchestral concert looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short feature piece, maybe about 10-15 minutes long</li>
  <li>A medium-length piece, usually a concerto <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> or a short symphony</li>
  <li>A long piece, usually a symphony or some other multi-movement work</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see this pretty clearly in the format of MasterWorks <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> concerts from the TSO’s last season:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Images/MW Concerts Format 19-20 with legend.png" alt="Visualization showing the length of pieces in Toronto Symphony MasterWorks Concerts" /></p>

<p class="image-caption">A visual summary of the duration <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and placement of pieces in TSO MasterWorks concerts planned for the 2019/20 season. Rows represent individual concert programs, with each piece colour-coded by type. The large uncoloured gaps represent intermissions. Concerts have been ordered by onset of intermission for visual clarity <sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Most of the time, pieces by living composers get put into the “short feature piece” slot. I’m don’t know for sure why this is, so I can only speculate. Maybe this is because writing or commissioning new music for orchestra involves a lot of expense and effort, so long pieces written by living composers are rarer. Another potential reason is the fact that orchestra concerts themselves are expensive to produce, so it’s risky to bet your biggest piece on something audiences don’t already know and love.</p>

<p>A slightly more cynical take would be that, for some people, new music has a reputation of being hard to listen to, so keeping it short and early in the program makes concerts tolerable for audience members who don’t like abstract or atonal music that much. The Baltimore Symphony has a good <a href="https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/reconsidering-our-assumptions-about-new-music/">blog post about the reputation that “new music” has with audiences</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, it’s notable when works by a composer of colour, or a woman composer (or honestly, a living composer) takes the longest spot on the program. In fact, the Institute for Composer Diversity <a href="https://www.composerdiversity.com/programming">specifically makes a point of recommending</a> that Orchestras “Include more substantial works by composers from underrepresented groups in the second or third positions on the program.”</p>

<h3 id="representation-in-marketing-materials">Representation in marketing materials</h3>

<p>Marketing focus is also an interesting way to think about programming, and is reflected in the title of a concert program, its description, and the images used to sell it. My guess is that in most orchestras, the names and descriptions for concert programs are primarily written by the marketing department, with some input from the artistic staff.</p>

<p>Concerts are most commonly named after the most well-known piece on the program, the featured soloist or conductor, or some combination of both. It’s very rare for a concert program title to be based on a living composer, unless it’s a Pops Concert (e.g. “Music of John Williams”). It’s notable when this occasionally happens, since it signifies an intentional artistic decision or that the living composer is popular enough that their name will sell tickets.</p>

<p>Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy had some <a href="https://wophil.org/2017-18-season-by-the-numbers/?doing_wp_cron=1609128744.0469379425048828125000">good notes on this subject in their 2017/18 season analysis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is worth noting that even though these works are being performed, they are not necessarily being recognized or promoted.  There were disturbingly few mentions of works by women in the online or print descriptions of each concert, even when the included work was commissioned.  For example, the Seattle Symphony has included Lili Boulanger’s <em>D’un matin de printemps</em> for a program titled Rachmaninov Symphony No. 3, taking place in February.  The other works on the program include Elgar’s Violin Concerto and, of course, the Rachmaninov Symphony.  The description for the event, however, only mentions two of the three[.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you may have guessed, Boulanger’s piece is the one out of the three not mentioned in the concert description—and this is only one out of four examples WPA included of women composers being ignored in marketing materials. (I would highly encourage you to go <a href="https://wophil.org/2017-18-season-by-the-numbers/?doing_wp_cron=1609128744.0469379425048828125000">read the whole post</a> - it’s very good.)</p>

<h2 id="up-next-streaming-services-and-their-classical-playlists">Up next: streaming services and their classical playlists</h2>

<p>At some point I want to explore to the various season analyses that are linked below. Before that (in the next post), I’m going to use some of my own research to take a look at representation in some of the biggest classical and orchestral playlists from Spotify and Apple Music.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: it’s not great.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/all-stories">Baltimore Symphony Orchestra</a> had a series called “By the Numbers” analyzing the concert seasons of top US orchestras:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/the-2014-15-orchestra-season-by-the-numbers.aspx" target="_blank">Baltimore 2014/15 (22 Orchestras)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/what-data-tells-us-about-the-2015-16-orchestra-season.aspx" target="_blank">Baltimore 2015/16 (89 Orchestras)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/the-data-behind-the-2016-2017-orchestra-season/" target="_blank">Baltimore 2016/17 (85 Orchestras)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Baltimore series stopped after three seasons, but <a href="https://wophil.org/">Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy</a> started doing their own season analysis starting in 2016/17 with a smaller list of 21 orchestras <a class="annotation-link">8</a>
<span class="annotation">I think the intention was to continue using the 21 orchestras that Baltimore had initially looked at for 2014/15, though Baltimore later added Nashville, bringing their 2014/15 number up to 22.</span> as a way to highlight the lack of women composers represented in orchestra programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wophil.org/works-by-women-in-the-2016-2017-season/?doing_wp_cron=1609362368.6617569923400878906250" target="_blank">WPA 2016/17</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wophil.org/2017-18-season-by-the-numbers/?doing_wp_cron=1609128744.0469379425048828125000" target="_blank">WPA 2017/18</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wophil.org/2018-19-season-by-the-numbers/?doing_wp_cron=1609129077.7042410373687744140625" target="_blank">WPA 2018/19</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Another organization, called DONNE, <a href="https://donne-uk.org/orchestras-research/">has been doing similar analysis for a more global set of 15 orchestras</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://donne-uk.org/2018-2019/" target="_blank">DONNE 2018/19</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://donne-uk.org/2019-2020/" target="_blank">DONNE 2019/20</a></li>
</ul>

<p>DONNE also has a research page with links to other studies on representation in music, including <a href="https://www.presencecompositrices.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bilan-Novembre-2019-_OBSERVER.pdf">one on (mostly-classical) French music festivals</a>, which I have put on my reading list.</p>

<p>Most recently, the <a href="https://www.composerdiversity.com/">Institute for Composer Diversity</a> was founded within the School of Music at the State University of New York at Fredonia. They published an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210530071525/https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons">analysis of Orchestra Seasons for 2019/20</a> that includes data from 120 orchestras. Their analysis looks at representation of composers from underrepresented racial, ethnic, or cultural heritages in addition to gender.</p>

In reality, I would guess the median concert runtime is probably about 110 minutes due to stage resets between pieces, introductions, etc. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
