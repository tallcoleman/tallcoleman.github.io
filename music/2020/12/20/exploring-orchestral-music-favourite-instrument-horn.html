I used to be in a youth orchestra, I work for an orchestra now‚Äîorchestral music plays a big role in my life.</p> <p>However, lots of people find getting into orchestral music intimidating. Even I do, from time to time. So I thought I would write about some creative ways that people can explore orchestral music and find new pieces that they like. My hope is that this will be informative for people who are new to orchestral music, and interesting to people who already feel they know orchestral music pretty well.</p> <p>I‚Äôm going to start with the way that I found a lot of pieces I like to listen to now: by looking at pieces that feature a favourite instrument. If you‚Äôve played an instrument, and liked it, that‚Äôs often a good way to get into music. However, even just being a fan of a certain instrument is a great way to find some music that you‚Äôll love.</p> <h2 id="pieces-with-good-french-horn-parts">Pieces with good French Horn parts</h2> <p>I played French Horn throughout high school and into University, and this helped introduce me to a number of great pieces of orchestral music. In some cases, I learned about pieces I liked by playing them (e.g. Tchaikovsy‚Äôs sixth symphony, Bizet‚Äôs <em>Carmen</em>), but in other cases I learned about pieces through excerpts.</p> <p>Excerpts are small sections from pieces that musicians have to play when they do orchestra auditions. (In most cases, they will be required to play a full piece or movement from a pieces as well). Excerpts are meant to demonstrate their ability to play a broad range of music and their skill with some of the most challenging or high-stakes parts they might encounter playing with the orchestra.</p> <p>Naturally, if you‚Äôre a fan of a certain instrument, looking through the pieces on an audition list is a great way to find pieces that feature some pretty amazing parts.</p> <p>I‚Äôm going to take some top picks for French Horn, but you could do this for any instrument you‚Äôre a fan of. Just search for ‚Äúfavourite instrument‚Äù + ‚Äúexcerpts‚Äù or ‚Äúfavourite instrument‚Äù + ‚Äúaudition list‚Äù and you‚Äôll find lots to get you started. Maybe I‚Äôll do a couple other instruments in later posts.</p> <p>I‚Äôve put links to albums on Spotify and also links to the <a href="https://www.hornsociety.org/hornexcerpts-org">International Horn Society‚Äôs excerpts pages</a> so that you can easily find the parts I‚Äôm talking about.</p> <script defer="" src="/scripts/spotifyEmbedLoader2.js"></script> <div class="panel panel-info"> <h2 class="panel-heading panel-info" id="embedded-spotify-players">Embedded Spotify Players</h2> <p>If you click the button below, it will load embedded Spotify players for each of the pieces described.

Although it doesn‚Äôt sound like it, it‚Äôs absolute murder to play since holding long, high notes without a break is a real workout for the lips.</p> <p>The horn player in this recording is presumably Dale Clevenger, who retired in 2013 after nearly five decades as Chicago‚Äôs principal horn.</p> <h3 id="bonus-holst-the-planets-second-movement-venus-the-bringer-of-peace">Bonus: Holst <em>The Planets</em>, Second Movement ‚ÄúVenus, the Bringer of Peace‚Äù</h3> <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2voC37VwC0NcD4LME5t6sS" target="_blank" class="spotify-no-embed-link">üîó Spotify: Toronto Symphony Orchestra</a></p> <div class="spotify-embed" data-spotifytype="track" data-spotifyuri="2voC37VwC0NcD4LME5t6sS"></div> <p>Another famous and incredibly serene French Horn solo.

I think it‚Äôs a good demonstration that being a good horn player often isn‚Äôt about playing things that are super complicated and fiddly, but rather playing things that often sound simple while achieving the best sound possible.</p> <h2 id="ravel-pavane-for-a-dead-princess">Ravel: <em>Pavane for a Dead Princess</em></h2> <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2DmlTLFphBLAIACKPsLAQH" target="_blank" class="spotify-no-embed-link">üîó Spotify: Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg</a></p> <div class="spotify-embed" data-spotifytype="track" data-spotifyuri="2DmlTLFphBLAIACKPsLAQH"></div> <p>An all time classic.

The principal horn on the recording is Shelly Showers, who now is part of the Philadelphia Orchestra (they‚Äôve got some incredible horn section bench strength over there‚Ä¶)</p> <p>That‚Äôs it for today - the next post will be looking at ways to explore living and diverse composers.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Most people consider French Horn to be a hard instrument to consistently play in tune because of how much the pitch can be affected by what you do with your lips and the hand that sits in the bell. These four notes are particularly difficult because they have to be played with the bell end of the horn held up in the air, which makes playing in tune even harder (no hand control and harder to keep the mouthpiece stable on your lips). The video with Sarah Willis linked below gives a good demonstration of how the hand can sometimes be used to help manage pitch.¬†<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </article> </div> </main> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="footer-col-wrapper"> <div class="footer-col footer-col-1"> <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png"/></a> </div> <div class="footer-col footer-col-2"> </div> <div class="footer-col footer-col-3"> <p>A Blog on Politics, Nature, and Culture </p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
