    <p>I’ve been spending a lot of time recently writing internal-facing reports, so it’s nice to be able to write something to share with the world.

<blockquote>
  <p>The ACTION report page</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was lucky enough to be able to write about <a href="http://www.tiff.net/events/2167/">2167</a>, an indigneous VR exhibit that’s been housed at TIFF for about the past half-year (and travelled around–it’s been to Yellowknife!). There are “VR Experiences” on show, and I spoke to the creator/director of one titled <a href="http://www.tiff.net/exhibitions/the-hunt/"><em>The Hunt</em></a>. Her name is Danis Goulet, and she is a Cree/Métis filmmaker, TIFF Short Cuts programmer, and an absolute pleasure to interview.</p>

<p>To see all of the interesting things that she said about VR, Sci-Fi, and Indigenous filmmaking, go and <a href="http://www.tiff.net/action-report/fall2017/indigenous-virtual-futures/">read the interview</a>. <em>The Review</em>, another great TIFF publication also did an excellent interview with Danis and some of the other VR filmmakers that you can <a href="http://www.tiff.net/the-review/indigenous-existence-is-resistance/">read here</a>. It talks a lot more about the actual filmmaking and the art behind VR, so it’s a fantastic read if you’re into those elements of the project.</p>

<p>But for this blog, there’s one tidbit I didn’t have space for in the piece that I wanted to share:</p>

<p>In her interview, Danis talks about getting started as a casting director and how her experiences during casting motivated her to make her own films. While I was doing my pre-interview research, I found out that one of the gigs she had was doing the Canadian casting for <em>Mean Girls</em>, which meant casting all the extras and many of the smaller roles. Apparently the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KY8WU0oa3I">Kevin Gnapoor rap</a> is burned into her brain now.</p>

<p>That being said, after I asked her all my <em>Mean Girls</em> questions, I did do the real interview with her, which you can read on the <a href="http://www.tiff.net/action-report/fall2017/indigenous-virtual-futures/">TIFF Website</a>.</p>
