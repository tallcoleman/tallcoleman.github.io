<h1 id="notes-on-the-student-census">Notes on the Student Census</h1>

<p>I had two primary motivations behind the idea of having a student census.  First, to make sure that the UTSU was getting feedback from students on its services and events, so that we could more effectively improve both.  Second, to find out more about students’ cost of living, quality of education, and quality of campus life.</p>

<p>However, for this year, at least, I believe there are suitable alternatives that can be used to obtain similar information.</p>

<p>To get feedback on the UTSU, our VP Internal and Services, Cameron Wathey, has implemented a questionnaire on UTSU services and events, the results of which will be released to the board at a later date.  You can view the survey here <a href="http://tallcoleman.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/member_survey.pdf">member_survey</a> and I’ve been told copies are available at the UTSU office and at our events.</p>

<p>To find out about students’ cost of living, there are several options:</p>

<p>An idea of what students pay for housing can be gained from data provided by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation on rent prices in Toronto neighborhoods.  Furthermore, the U of T housing facebook page and past kijiji postings can be used as an indicator of what price bracket students usually are in for rental prices.</p>

<p>For the cost of food, the UTSU has an ongoing survey about food on campus.  Furthermore, the City of Toronto has an index of food costs based on the Health Canada Nutritious Food Basket (HCNFB).  Crucially, the HCNFB is used when determining how much money to give OSAP students to pay for food, although in the OSAP calculation, the Ontario average cost for the HCNFB is used, meaning that students who live downtown don’t get nearly enough money from OSAP to buy groceries.</p>

<p>I hope this year to perform the Health Canada survey and produce a cost schedule for the nutritious food basket for the neighborhoods around U of T St. George where many students live.  This would include food vendors like Metro, the Bloor St. Market, and shops in Kensington, and could also serve as a guide for budgeting and finding the best places to buy food.  With this information, and the City of Toronto food cost schedule, hopefully we can convince the Ontario Government to give more food money to OSAP students.</p>

<p>I’d love to know who at U of T commutes, how far, and using which transit systems.  However, I don’t have time this year to take on the project of surveying commuter students.  If someone else wants to do this, please do, and then share the data.</p>

<p>For quality of education, U of T already solicits feedback on courses from students.  The numerical results are already available online.  Furthermore, I consolidated all of them into one file over the summer, which you can download here: <a href="http://tallcoleman.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/course-evaluations-clean-dataset.xlsx">Course Evaluations Clean Dataset</a>  I hope that the written comments are made available in some form, as they were in the Anti-Calendar, when you could get a summary of what the most common written comments were.</p>

<p>For quality of campus life, the best resource to look at to understand what’s most commonly on the mind of U of T students is a report done by the U of T administration which summarizes the results of focus groups which dealt with campus life issues.  It was from this report, called “In their own words” that the U of T administration came up with the idea of having a co-curricular record, I believe.  The report is available here: <a href="http://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/intheirownwords.htm">http://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/intheirownwords.htm</a></p>

<p>Overall, while I still believe it would be beneficial to have a student census, I think that for the time being, we can still find out enough about students and their needs to improve the UTSU and effectively advocate for change from the U of T administration and the provincial government.</p>
