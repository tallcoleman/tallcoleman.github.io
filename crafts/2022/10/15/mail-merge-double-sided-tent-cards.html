Ideally you want to be able to print their name on <em>both</em> sides of the card so that it’s easily visible. This is how you do it:</p> <p>The main trick is to ignore the default template that Word or the Avery website gives you, and to make your own template, <em>sideways</em> <sup id="fnref:why-sideways" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:why-sideways" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> <h2 id="instructions-avery-5305-two-to-a-page-tent-cards">Instructions: Avery 5305 Two-to-a-Page Tent Cards</h2> <p>For the detailed instructions, I’m using the example of two-to-a-page cards like Avery 5305, but there are <a href="#other-sizes">additional instructions at the end</a> for tent or place cards where you have one, four, or six cards on a page; or for cards from other brands such as St. James Overtures or JAM Paper.</p> <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-primary panel-heading"> <p><strong>Additional Instructions for Other Sizes:</strong></p> </div> <ul> <li><a href="#avery-5309-one-to-a-page">Avery 5309 (one-to-a-page)</a></li> <li><a href="#st-james-overtures-tent-cards-two-to-a-page">St. James Overtures Tent Cards (two-to-a-page)</a></li> <li><a href="#avery-5302-four-to-a-page">Avery 5302 (four-to-a-page)</a></li> <li><a href="#avery-5011-six-to-a-page">Avery 5011 (six-to-a-page)</a></li> <li><a href="#st-james-overtures-place-cards-six-to-a-page">St. James Overtures Place Cards (six-to-a-page)</a></li> <li><a href="#jam-paper-place-cards-six-to-a-page">JAM Paper place cards (six-to-a-page)</a></li> </ul> </div> <p>If you run into any problems during the steps below, make sure to check out the <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting section</a> for tips that might help.</p> <h3 id="set-up">Set Up</h3> <p><img src="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Tent Card Table Set Up.png" alt="Microsoft Word application window with a four-column table set up"/></p> <ol> <li> <p>Open a new word document and set the layout to Landscape.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the page margins to <abbr title="inches">0.5"</abbr> on the top and sides, and 0" on the bottom.

You might need to type a little bit of text in each column to check.</p> </li> <li> <p>Style your text so that it looks the way you want it (I often will use the “Preview” button on the “Mailings” tab to skip through to the longest name and set the font size based on that.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the “Mailings” tab, select “Update Labels”.</p> </li> <li> <p>At this point, it will show a new name in each column — to fix this, delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;Next Record&gt;&gt;</code> merge fields in the even columns (e.g. 2 and 4). You will have to turn off “Preview” if you have that on.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the borders on your table and check that everything looks the way you want it.

You can set cell margins for the whole table by selecting your table and then selecting “Layout” &gt; “Cell Margins” in the ribbon.</p> <p>The one thing to note is that adding margin at the top or bottom of a cell increases the the table size, so you have to shorten your cell size by the same amount — see the <a href="#setting-cell-margin-offsets">margin offsets section</a> for more information.</p> </div> <h3 id="printing">Printing</h3> <p><img src="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Tent Card Finished Preview.png" alt="Microsoft Word application window showing off a preview of the finished set up"/></p> <ol> <li> <p>Using the “Mailings” tab, select “Finish and Merge” and then “Edit Individual Documents”.</p> </li> <li> <p>Save the newly-generated file and check to make sure that everything merged correctly.</p> </li> <li> <p>At this point, it’s usually a good idea to try printing just one page to make sure you know how to correctly orient your cards in the feed tray. I usually run it through with a piece of paper that has “Top” written on the top of one side so you can figure out the correct rotation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you’re confident that everything is set up correctly, print out your cards and have fun separating them and folding them up!</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="other-sizes">Other Sizes</h2> <h3 id="avery-5309-one-to-a-page">Avery 5309 (one-to-a-page)</h3> <p>For one-to-a-page cards like Avery 5309, the correct set-up is:</p> <ul> <li>Set page orientation to portrait;</li> <li>Set page margins of <abbr title="inches">0.5"</abbr> on the top, 0.75" on the sides, and 0" on the bottom;</li> <li>Insert a 2 col x 1 row table; and</li> <li>Set cell size to 10" tall and 3.5" wide.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://tallcoleman.me/assets/Images/Avery 5309 Layout Example.png" alt="Microsoft Word application window showing the layout for Avery 5309"/></p> <p>From here, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with <a href="#set-up">step 4 of Set Up</a>, and make sure to delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;Next Record&gt;&gt;</code> tag in column 2.</p> <h3 id="st-james-overtures-tent-cards-two-to-a-page">St. James Overtures Tent Cards (two-to-a-page)</h3> <p>Based on the product information online, St. James Overtures tent cards appear not to have any margin or gutter.

However, if you add padding on the top or bottom of table cells, make sure to reduce the cell size by the same amount.</p> <p>From here, follow the detailed instructions above, starting with <a href="#set-up">step 4 of Set Up</a>.</p> <h2 id="setting-cell-margin-offsets">Setting Cell Margin Offsets</h2> <p>For templates with four or six cards per page, you may have to set specific margins for different rows and columns in your table to account for the gutter (space) between cards.</p> <p>In Word, you can either set margins at the <em>table</em> level (i.e. the same margins for all cells), or at the <em>cell</em> level (specific margins that might be different from cell to cell). In this case, we want to set the margins at the cell level <sup id="fnref:cell-overrides-table" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cell-overrides-table" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p> <p>To do this, you can set per-cell settings using Word’s “Cell Options” dialog. To get to Cell Options, you can select your desired table cells, right-click, select “Table Properties…”, go to the “Cell” tab, and then select “Options…”. The “Cell Options” dialog will then open; with this menu, you can uncheck Cell margins “Same as the whole table” and then set specific margins for your selected cells only.</p> <div class="panel panel-info"> <div class="panel-info panel-heading"> <p>💡 <strong>Tip: Select Multiple Discontinuous Cells At Once</strong></p> </div> <p>To select multiple cells that are not next to each other, e.g. cells in both column 1 and column 3 of a table, hold down the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl</code> key on Windows or the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command</code> key on Mac.</p> </div> <h3 id="adding-cell-options-to-your-quick-access-toolbar">Adding Cell Options To Your Quick Access Toolbar</h3> <p>Since it takes a lot of steps to open the Cell Options dialog, you may want to add it to your <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/customize-the-quick-access-toolbar-43fff1c9-ebc4-4963-bdbd-c2b6b0739e52">Quick Access Toolbar</a> with the following steps:</p> <p>On Windows, select “File”, then “Options”, then “Quick Access Toolbar”. Using the drop-down at the top-left, select Choose commands from: “Commands Not in the Ribbon”. Find and select “Cell Options…” in the left column, and then select the “Add &gt;&gt;” button in the middle.</p> <p>On Mac, select “Word”, then “Preferences”. Select “Ribbon &amp; Toolbar” and then choose the “Quick Access Toolbar” tab at the top. Using the drop-down at the top-left, select Choose commands from: “Commands Not in the Ribbon”. Find and select “Table Cell Options” in the left column, and then select the “&gt;” button in the middle.</p> <p>Select “OK” or “Save” to return to Word, and a circle icon should appear at the very top that opens the “Cell Options” dialog directly.</p> <h3 id="calculating-offsets">Calculating Offsets</h3> <p>When adding margin offsets, you will need to add the offset <em>in addition to</em> any cell margin you want to set. You will also have to adjust table row heights to offset any margin you add at the top or bottom of a cell.</p> <p>I’ll show you how to make these adjustments with two examples using the <a href="#avery-5302-four-to-a-page">Avery 5302 (four-to-a-page) template</a>:</p> <h3 id="example-1-offset-margin-only">Example 1: Offset Margin Only</h3> <p>Follow the first four bullet points in the <a href="#avery-5302-four-to-a-page">Avery 5302 instructions</a> to set your page orientation and margins, insert a 4x2 table, and set the cell size. Then select the entire table and set all the margins to zero using Cell Options.</p> <p>Notice that the margin at the bottom of the page currently appears to be larger than the margin at the top — this is because the cell height of 3.5" intentionally excludes the two 0.25" offsets we will be adding.</p> <p>To add the row offsets, select row 1 of the table, and then set the bottom margin to 0.25" using Cell Options. Then select row 2 and set its top margin to 0.25". The margins at the top and bottom of the page should now look the same size because Word includes top and bottom cell margins <em>in addition to</em> your cell dimensions.</p> <p>To add the column offset, hold down <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl</code> (Windows) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command</code> (Mac) and select columns 1 and 3. Using Cell Options, set the left margin to 0.25". Then select columns 2 and 4, and set their right margin to 0.25". Notice that the width of the table has not changed — this is because Word includes left and right cell margins <em>inside</em> your cell dimensions.</p> <p>In summary, adding top and bottom cell margins makes your table taller, but adding left and right cell margins does not make your table wider. So you only need to worry about top and bottom margins when calculating the cell sizes you need.</p> <h3 id="example-2-custom-and-offset-margins-together">Example 2: Custom and Offset Margins Together</h3> <p>Let’s say that we want to have a margin of 0.1" in our cells in addition to the offsets so that long text doesn’t run all the way to the edge. We can do this as follows:</p> <p>Like before, follow the first four bullet points in the <a href="#avery-5302-four-to-a-page">Avery 5302 instructions</a> to set your page orientation and margins, insert a 4x2 table, and set the cell size. Then select the entire table and this time, set all the margins to 0.1" using Cell Options.</p> <p>With the custom margins, we’ve now added an additional 0.1" at the top and 0.1" at the bottom, which means we need to make our cells 0.2" shorter to compensate. To do that, select the entire table, and set the cell size to 3.3" tall instead of 3.5".</p> <p>Now we’re going to <em>add</em> our offsets to the existing margins, so each margin with an offset will be set at 0.35" (0.1" margin + 0.25" offset):</p> <ul> <li>Columns 1, 3: Left margin of 0.35"</li> <li>Columns 2, 4: Right margin of 0.35"</li> <li>Row 1: Bottom margin of 0.35"</li> <li>Row 2: Top margin of 0.35"</li> </ul> <p>With everything done correctly, the table dimensions should look exactly the same as before.</p> <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2> <h3 id="my-merged-document-doesnt-print">My merged document doesn’t print</h3> <p>I’m not sure how common this issue is, but I’ve run into it occasionally.

However, we usually set our bottom margin 0" to prevent blank pages from being generated when you do your mail merge.</p> <p>If your template requires you to have 0" page margins on the sides, then there’s no easy way around this warning. If the warning is popping up while you’re trying to print, try exporting to PDF and printing from the PDF instead.</p> <p>If it’s only your bottom page margin that’s 0", there are a couple alternative options you can try:</p> <p>Option A: select “fix” when the “outside printable area” warning comes up, and re-open the page margin options to make sure your top, left, and right margins haven’t changed. If you end up with a second blank page after your table, select the blank paragraph on the second page, and set the font size to be really small (e.g. 5pt or 2pt). Once the blank paragraph is small enough, the second blank page should go away.</p> <p>Option B: Select the blank paragraph on the second page, open the Format &gt; Font dialog, and check “Hidden”. As long as the “Show Invisibles” <sup id="fnref:show-invisibles" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:show-invisibles" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> option isn’t turned on, the second page should go away.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:why-sideways" role="doc-endnote"> <p>The main problem is that while Word can have text oriented 90 degrees sideways in either direction, it can’t orient text upside down.

Any cell with “Same as the whole table” unchecked becomes completely disconnected from the table-level settings, and table-level left and right margins won’t affect these cells. However, top or bottom margins appear to affect an entire table row, regardless of whether they’re set at the table level, or whether they’re set on just one cell in a row. <a href="#fnref:cell-overrides-table" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:show-invisibles" role="doc-endnote"> <p>i.e. the pilcrow button (¶) that shows things like spaces, tab marks, and — relevant to this case — hidden text. <a href="#fnref:show-invisibles" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </article> </div> </main> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="footer-col-wrapper"> <div class="footer-col footer-col-1"> <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png"/></a> </div> <div class="footer-col footer-col-2"> </div> <div class="footer-col footer-col-3"> <p>A Blog on Politics, Nature, and Culture </p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
